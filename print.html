<h2 id="ownership-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#ownership-in-rust">Ownership in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what ownership is in Rust and why it exists.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-ownership"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ownership">What is Ownership?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ownership refers to a variable that is responsible for deleting the data it represents when the variable ends its
scope.</li>
<li>Unlike property rights in real life, ownership confers no benefits to the owner. The owning variable doesn’t have
preferential access to the data it owns nor can it prevent others from accessing what is owned.</li>
<li>Rust needs to know when it’s safe to delete data since there’s no garbage collector like other programming languages
such as Java or Python. This leads to ownership being used instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-ownership-works"><a class="header" href="#how-ownership-works">How Ownership Works</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust only allows a single owner, so when an owner leaves scope or becomes invalid, it must be safe to delete the owned
data.</li>
<li>To create an owner, you create a value and bind it to a variable. Once you’ve created the data, you create an owner.</li>
<li>We can transfer ownership in Rust through moving or copying semantics. Moving transfers ownership while copying
duplicates the data and creates two owners.</li>
<li>When we transfer ownership through assignment, only the new name can be used since ownership has moved there.</li>
<li>Another way of transferring ownership is by moving into a function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-ownership-exists"><a class="header" href="#why-ownership-exists">Why Ownership Exists</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ownership exists because Rust does not have a garbage collector like other programming languages such as Java or
Python. Including one would impose runtime costs and make performance less predictable by introducing latency and
pauses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="passing-variables-to-functions"><a class="header" href="#passing-variables-to-functions">Passing Variables to Functions</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how variables are passed into functions in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="ownership-and-the-end-of-a-variables-life-cycle"><a class="header" href="#ownership-and-the-end-of-a-variables-life-cycle">Ownership and the End of a Variable’s Life Cycle</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When an owner’s scope ends or becomes invalid, any resources it owns are deleted.</li>
<li>Data is deleted when there is no owner for it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-loops-and-ownership-transfer"><a class="header" href="#for-loops-and-ownership-transfer">For Loops and Ownership Transfer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ownership transfers into a loop, making the variable inaccessible after the loop finishes.</li>
<li>Looping over references does not move ownership; ownership stays where it was.</li>
<li>If you have a reference to the variable or a mutable reference, you can still access the variable after the loop has
finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="string-literals-and-no-owner"><a class="header" href="#string-literals-and-no-owner">String Literals and No Owner</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>String literals behave differently because they don’t actually own the data that they refer to. They are kept alive
for the whole program.</li>
<li>Variables of string literals have the type <code>&amp;str</code>, which is a reference to a string slice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section concludes the talk on ownership in Rust.</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker hopes that viewers enjoyed the talk and encourages them to ask questions in the comments.</li>
<li>The book “Rust in Action” explains ownership in depth, and viewers can use a discount code provided by the speaker to

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces themselves and the topic of discussion, which is Rust borrow
checker.</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker mentions that they are live and invites viewers to ask questions.</li>
<li>They introduce the topic of Rust borrow checker and mention that it is a construct within the compiler that ensures
every access to memory is valid.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-of-rust-borrow-checker"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-rust-borrow-checker">Overview of Rust Borrow Checker</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker provides an overview of Rust borrow checker.</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that they will be playing around with references and creating an object for digital input.</li>
<li>They define what a borrow is and create a type definition for digital input.</li>
<li>They add derived blocks for plug, equality, partial load quality, and debug to enable printing input to the screen and
comparing different input sources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modifying-digital-input"><a class="header" href="#modifying-digital-input">Modifying Digital Input</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker demonstrates how to modify digital input in Rust.</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker creates a function called “receive” that takes an input variant as an argument.</li>
<li>They use the question mark operator again and replace analog with digital to receive data from a digital input.</li>
<li>They print out the received value using println! macro.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-a-warning-restriction"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-warning-restriction"><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:07:15">#</a> Adding a Warning Restriction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker adds a warning restriction to avoid compiler warnings.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-warning-restriction-1"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-warning-restriction-1">Adding a Warning Restriction</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:07:39"></a> Added a warning restriction to allow dead code inside the function.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:07:48"></a> The compiler warning is now restricted, which is helpful because we don’t want it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what borrow checker is and how it works in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-function-arguments-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#types-of-function-arguments-in-rust">Types of Function Arguments in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:09:31"></a> Functions in Rust can take three types of arguments - ownership, mutable borrower, and immutable
borrower.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:10:09"></a> Ownership is another stretched metaphor where the owner of a value is responsible for destroying the
value at the end of its scope.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:10:45"></a> Receive function becomes the owner of input data and deletes it at the end of its scope. Accessing
digital on lines 23 and 24 becomes illegal.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:11:13"></a> Added an ampersand as an immutable borrow to fix ownership issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borrow-checker"><a class="header" href="#borrow-checker">Borrow Checker</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:08:41"></a> The borrow checker ensures that we can call receive twice without any issues.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:11.50"></a> Digital stays in line 20, and we only pass a reference into receive from digital. Receive will clear up
the reference to its input once the call is finished.</li>

<h2 id="difference-between-string-and-str"><a class="header" href="#difference-between-string-and-str">Difference between String and &amp;str</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains the difference between String and &amp;str in Rust programming.</p>
<h3 id="string-vs-str"><a class="header" href="#string-vs-str">String vs. &amp;str</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A String is more versatile than a string slice (&amp;str).</li>
<li>A string slice has fewer methods.</li>
<li>A string slice doesn’t allow any extra information to be appended at the end.</li>
<li>If we try to compile a program with a string slice, we’ll receive an error message from the compiler saying that
push_str or reference &amp;str won’t work.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a String will compile and run without any issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strings-and-strs-always-look-different"><a class="header" href="#strings-and-strs-always-look-different">Strings and Strs Always Look Different</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about how Strings and strs always look different in Rust
programming.</p>
<h3 id="representation-of-strings-in-source-code"><a class="header" href="#representation-of-strings-in-source-code">Representation of Strings in Source Code</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you see a string literal in Rust, it is never an actual string.</li>
<li>It is a “string slice” which has “&amp;str” as its type.</li>
<li>If we tell Rust that it’s a string, we’ll get an error message from the compiler saying that it expected a string but
found an &amp;str instead.</li>
<li>To convert an &amp;str to a String, we can use the “to_string()” method.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-ampersand-necessary"><a class="header" href="#why-is-ampersand-necessary">Why Is Ampersand Necessary?</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why ampersand is necessary when dealing with strings and slices
in Rust programming.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-ampersand"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-ampersand">The Role of Ampersand</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The ampersand precedes the type (string slice) because it indicates that we are borrowing data rather than owning it.</li>
<li>When we borrow data using &amp;, we don’t have to worry about deallocating memory since ownership remains with the
original owner of data.</li>
<li>Without &amp;, Rust would not know how much memory to allocate for str since its size cannot be known at compilation time.</li>
<li>Therefore, the ampersand is necessary to indicate that we are borrowing data and not owning it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-rust-strings"><a class="header" href="#understanding-rust-strings"><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:04:57s">#</a> Understanding Rust Strings</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how Rust handles strings and string slices. They discuss the
conflict beginners face when trying to understand why the Rust compiler behaves in a certain way and explain how
references are used to get around fixed size limitations.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-size-limitations"><a class="header" href="#fixed-size-limitations">Fixed Size Limitations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:05:01s"></a> Beginners often struggle with understanding why the Rust compiler behaves in a certain way.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:05:23s"></a> Every function call needs to be of a fixed size, which makes it difficult to fit things of arbitrary
length inside something that requires a fixed length.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:06:02s"></a> References are used to get around fixed size limitations by adding a reference to the text, which has a
fixed size represented internally as a number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="string-capacity"><a class="header" href="#string-capacity">String Capacity</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:07:32s"></a> Strings have more than just an internal pointer and length of bytes; they also have capacity.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:08:18s"></a> The capacity of strings can change, allowing for reserving extra space.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borrowing"><a class="header" href="#borrowing">Borrowing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:09:03s"></a> Borrowing is one of the most fundamental distinctions between strings and string slices.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:09:14s"></a> A string is called an “owned value,” whereas a string slice is called a “borrowed value.”</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:09:52s"></a> When welcome leaves scope, it will delete any data that it owns. However, borrowed values do not own
data and will not delete anything.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this video, the speaker explains the differences between Rust strings and string slices. He
demonstrates how to create a function that prints a message using both types of variables and highlights the limitations
of using strings.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-function-with-strings"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-function-with-strings">Creating a Function with Strings</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker creates a function called <code>print_message</code> that takes in a message as an argument.</li>
<li>When trying to pass in a string variable called <code>welcome</code>, which is defined outside of the function, the compiler
throws an error because it is not mutable.</li>
<li>If we change the definition of <code>welcome</code> to be a string instead of a variable, it will fail to compile because
once <code>welcome</code> leaves scope, it no longer exists.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borrowing-variables"><a class="header" href="#borrowing-variables">Borrowing Variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To get around this limitation, we can borrow the <code>welcome</code> variable again within the <code>print_message</code> function.</li>

<h3 id="handling-traffic-light-green"><a class="header" href="#handling-traffic-light-green">Handling Traffic Light Green</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust cannot return only traffic light green as the type is the actual enum itself.</li>
<li>Individual structs for each state can be used, but it becomes less comfortable to use.</li>
<li>A state machine composed of multiple different structures can be used, but there is a proposal that enables returning
smaller types. The speaker recommends reading Anna’s blog post on encoding transitions in the type system.</li>

<ul>
<li>The lines 13 to 20 are compiled once, while lines 23 through 25 are compiled three times because we apply three types.</li>
<li>We can provide some kind of dynamism and generic code without incurring all of the compile-time size cost as long as
we’re willing to trade off a little bit of runtime cost for this dynamic dispatch.</li>
<li>Dynamic dispatch isn’t necessary, so we can avoid it and have a marginal cost of an extra function call.</li>
<li>We can add an annotation which tells the compiler that it should always execute the function and not just copy out its
contents into the inner function. This will keep it small.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="deref-trait"><a class="header" href="#deref-trait">Deref Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Deref trait enables a type to masquerade as another type and convert itself into that type. <a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:48:58s"></a></li>
<li>This allows a type to implement methods that it doesn’t actually implement by calling those methods on the converted
type. <a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:49:34s"></a></li>
<li>The Deref trait is used implicitly by the compiler in many circumstances through drift coercion, which means that the
dereference operation coerces to another type. <a href="rust_video_summary/learn_rust_programming/t=0:54:07s"></a></li>
<li>Rust provides ergonomics through implicit use of the Deref trait, but it can be confusing if you are expecting

object-oriented languages.</p>
<h3 id="creating-accessor-methods"><a class="header" href="#creating-accessor-methods">Creating Accessor Methods</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In Rust, an underscore-based language, creating an accessor or getter method involves using underscores to create a
getter method.</li>
<li>Although some people may not like the idea of an accessor value, it is a common way of creating them.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is important in object-oriented languages. Raw access to attributes should be avoided by exposing only
the interface.</li>
<li>If we wanted to change x from up here and remove the field x, we could return x and use another method call instead of
get x.</li>
<li>Rust is particular about data use and reuse. To ensure safety, mutable access must be annotated.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-an-error"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-error">What is an Error?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An error is a message that indicates something has gone wrong during program execution.</li>
<li>A panic is a type of error that results in a crash. It can be altered to have different semantics.</li>
<li>Errors and results happen most often when dealing with input/output (I/O).</li>
<li>I/O refers to input/output not of function arguments but of devices interacting with a program from the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dealing-with-errors"><a class="header" href="#dealing-with-errors">Dealing with Errors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker introduces three strategies for dealing with errors: Propagating, Returning, and Unwrapping.</li>

found.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handling-file-io-errors-1"><a class="header" href="#handling-file-io-errors-1">Handling File I/O Errors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Result type can be used to handle file I/O errors by propagating them up through functions.</li>
<li>Another way of handling file I/O errors is by using unwrap() method which will either return Ok value or panic if
there’s an error. However, this approach should be used carefully as it can result in unexpected crashes.</li>
<li>The speaker recommends using the ? operator to handle file I/O errors as it provides a concise and safe way of
handling errors.</li>

<ul>
<li>To use conversion mechanisms like <code>?</code> operator with options and results, we need to define a new type by wrapping
option in it.</li>
<li>This is because the end result, option, and error are defined outside of this particular crate.</li>
<li>We cannot tinker with any of that since it’s already decided what it wants to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations-of-using-conversion-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-using-conversion-mechanisms">Limitations of Using Conversion Mechanisms</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The reason why using conversion mechanisms like <code>?</code> operator with options and results is failing is that we’re pulling
these from third parties or all from the standard library.</li>
<li>We can’t tinker with any of that since it’s already decided what it wants to do.</li>
<li>This problem isn’t seen in real-world use cases because normally you wouldn’t need to use the question mark operator
with options and results defined in standard libraries.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-rust"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-rust">Introduction to Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section introduces Rust and its type system. It also compares Rust with other programming
languages.</p>
<h3 id="rusts-type-system"><a class="header" href="#rusts-type-system">Rust’s Type System</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has an elaborate type system that provides guarantees at compile time.</li>
<li>Types are used for enforcing many of these guarantees statically.</li>
<li>Algebraic data types and pattern matching allow you to write nice code using types.</li>
<li>The comprehensive static typing in Rust reduces runtime crashes compared to Python.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comparison-with-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#comparison-with-other-languages">Comparison with Other Languages</a></h3>
<h4 id="python"><a class="header" href="#python">Python</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rust is much faster than Python because it is a compiled language without a runtime, resulting in lower memory use and
better multi-threading performance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="java"><a class="header" href="#java">Java</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rust has no runtime, resulting in lower memory use and generally higher performance than Java.</li>
<li>Zero cost abstractions in Rust enable the use of additional classes without any runtime performance cost, unlike Java
where this often comes at a cost.</li>
<li>Data races and concurrent modification exceptions common in Java go away in Rust due to compile-time guarantees
against them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cc"><a class="header" href="#cc">C/C++</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Segfaults, buffer overflows, null pointers, and data races common in C/C++ do not occur in Rust due to compile-time
checks against them.</li>
<li>The powerful type system provided by the language eliminates the need for void pointers or nasty type classing found
in C/C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-features-of-rust"><a class="header" href="#additional-features-of-rust">Additional Features of Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers additional features of the language that make it easy to write modular code bases.</p>
<h3 id="unified-build-system"><a class="header" href="#unified-build-system">Unified Build System</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cargo, the unified build system that comes with the compiler tool chain makes dependency management a lot easier.</li>
<li>All libraries and tools use the same build system, making it easy to add external dependencies from other libraries or
public repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparing-rust-and-go"><a class="header" href="#comparing-rust-and-go">Comparing Rust and Go</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section compares Rust and Go, two languages that are often compared to each other. The speaker
notes that while Go is an excellent language, Rust has some advantages over it.</p>
<h3 id="rust-vs-go"><a class="header" href="#rust-vs-go">Rust vs. Go</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has no garbage collector or runtime, which allows for higher performance than what can be achieved with Go code.</li>
<li>In Rust, there are no null pointers, whereas in Go, you have to manually check for nil values. Additionally, error
handling is much nicer in Rust than in Go.</li>
<li>Concurrency is easy in both languages but safer in Rust as it ensures there are no data races. In contrast,
concurrency in Go can lead to shooting oneself in the foot.</li>
<li>Both languages have a strong type system and zero-cost abstractions but Rust also offers modern features such as
efficient generics and algebraic data types with pattern matching. The toolchain that comes with the language makes it
easier to use than older languages like C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-of-rust"><a class="header" href="#features-of-rust">Features of Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses some of the key features of the Rust programming language.</p>
<h3 id="modern-language"><a class="header" href="#modern-language">Modern Language</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important things about Rust is that it’s a modern language that doesn’t feel like a low-level systems
language. It has nice and efficient generics similar to Java or type classes in C++ and algebraic data types with
pattern matching. The toolchain that comes with the language makes it easier to use than older languages like C++.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="efficient-generics"><a class="header" href="#efficient-generics">Efficient Generics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Generics allow for code reuse by allowing users to choose what type T should be used when writing generic code. In
Rust, this code gets compiled as if the generics weren’t there leading to really fast runtime performance.</li>
<li>The cost of function calls in generic code is optimized by the compiler, which can inline functions and compile them
for each instance of T and P.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="algebraic-data-types-with-pattern-matching"><a class="header" href="#algebraic-data-types-with-pattern-matching">Algebraic Data Types with Pattern Matching</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has algebraic data types with pattern matching, which allows for more concise and expressive code. This feature
is similar to sum types in functional programming languages like Haskell or ML.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modern-toolchain"><a class="header" href="#modern-toolchain">Modern Toolchain</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust comes with a modern toolchain that makes it easier to use than older languages like C++. Pain points that exist
with many older languages are just gone in Rust.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-features-overview"><a class="header" href="#rust-features-overview">Rust Features Overview</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section provides an overview of some of the key features of Rust, including algebraic data types,
pattern matching, and modern tooling.</p>
<h3 id="option-type-and-algebraic-data-types"><a class="header" href="#option-type-and-algebraic-data-types">Option Type and Algebraic Data Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The return type of a function in Rust is <code>Option reference to T</code>, which means that it can either return <code>Some</code> with a
pointer or <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>Rust allows for defining enumerations or types that contain other types. Unlike enums in other languages, these enums
can contain other things.</li>
<li>The <code>Option</code> type is an example of this. It is an enum that is generic over some T and contains either the <code>Some</code>
variant with that T or the <code>None</code> variant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pattern-matching"><a class="header" href="#pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust provides pattern matching to match over types that are these enums. This lets you tease out only the specific
values and variants that you care about.</li>
<li>The compiler will check that you have exhaustively matched, meaning if someone adds a variant to an enum later on,
your code will not break. The compiler will tell you “you also need to update this match over here”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modern-tooling"><a class="header" href="#modern-tooling">Modern Tooling</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By default, in Rust, the compiler knows about things like tests and documentation. You can annotate any function in
your code with #[test] attribute and then run cargo test to run it as a unit test.</li>
<li>You can place these tests in separate files or outside your source directory, and then they will be compiled as
integration tests which only have access to your public API. The compiler and build system know how to run all of
them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-safety-by-construction"><a class="header" href="#rust-safety-by-construction">Rust: Safety by Construction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how Rust provides safety by construction and the primary reasons for this.</p>
<h3 id="checking-pointers-at-compile-time"><a class="header" href="#checking-pointers-at-compile-time">Checking Pointers at Compile Time</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Rust compiler ensures that every value in your program has a single owner and that owner is responsible for
freeing that resource.</li>
<li>The compiler checks two properties for every variable: there is only ever one owner, and no pointers outlive the
owner.</li>
<li>If you guarantee these invariants, you cannot have double frees or use after free errors.</li>
<li>The borrow checker detects references that live past when their owners go away and rejects invalid code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="immutable-pointers-and-variables"><a class="header" href="#immutable-pointers-and-variables">Immutable Pointers and Variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pointers and variables in Rust are immutable by default.</li>
<li>Functions can take references to variables but not modify them unless given mutable access.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rusts-key-features"><a class="header" href="#rusts-key-features">Rust’s Key Features</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the key features of Rust, including its memory safety, thread safety, and no
hidden states.</p>
<h3 id="memory-safety"><a class="header" href="#memory-safety">Memory Safety</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust variables are immutable by default.</li>
<li>The <code>const</code> keyword in Rust applies transitively to all reachable values.</li>
<li>Immutable references can be safely shared with other code without fear of modification.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thread-safety"><a class="header" href="#thread-safety">Thread Safety</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust types know whether it’s safe for them to cross thread boundaries.</li>
<li>Rc and Arc are two reference counted wrapper types that ensure thread safety.</li>
<li>There can only ever be either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to any given value at any
given point in time. This ensures there can’t be data races.</li>
<li>The compiler checks for potential data races even across thread boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-hidden-states"><a class="header" href="#no-hidden-states">No Hidden States</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust uses the type system to ensure that you check every case.</li>
<li>Anytime where you see a reference, it is guaranteed not to be null.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rusts-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#rusts-error-handling">Rust’s Error Handling</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses Rust’s error handling system and how it differs from other
languages.</p>
<h3 id="rusts-error-handling-system"><a class="header" href="#rusts-error-handling-system">Rust’s Error Handling System</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust’s error handling system ensures that null checks are not forgotten by forcing the programmer to deal with errors.</li>
<li>The compiler will not allow errors to be ignored accidentally.</li>
<li>Examples of code that require error handling include find and parsing a string.</li>
<li>The question mark operator is a shortcut for bubbling up errors to the caller.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-rust"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-rust">Advantages of Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses some advantages of using Rust over other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-runtime-and-garbage-collector"><a class="header" href="#lack-of-runtime-and-garbage-collector">Lack of Runtime and Garbage Collector</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust does not have a garbage collector or runtime, which means there are no garbage collection pauses and lower memory
overhead in general.</li>
<li>You can issue system calls directly, such as fork and exec, which is often not possible in managed languages because
the runtime controls the program execution.</li>
<li>You can even run on a system without an OS because there is no code apart from your own that you need to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="free-ffi-calls"><a class="header" href="#free-ffi-calls">Free FFI Calls</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>FFI calls are free in Rust because there is no runtime that needs to be informed when calling out to another language
through an API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="low-level-control"><a class="header" href="#low-level-control">Low-Level Control</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In Rust, you have low-level control over both allocation and dispatch. Unlike Java or Go, nothing is automatically
heap allocated for you.</li>
<li>You can opt into heap allocation using the Box keyword or by declaring a vector.</li>
<li>You can swap out the entire allocator globally in your program if you wish, allowing you to use jemalloc, Google’s new
tcmalloc, or Microsoft’s mimalloc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-a-language-for-the-next-40-years"><a class="header" href="#rust-a-language-for-the-next-40-years">Rust: A Language for the Next 40 Years</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section introduces Rust as a language that offers low-level control and compatibility with other
languages.</p>
<h3 id="low-level-control-1"><a class="header" href="#low-level-control-1">Low-Level Control</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust allows for low-level code that is often written in C or assembly.</li>
<li>The <code>unsafe</code> keyword in Rust is used to assert invariants that the compiler cannot check. It provides an escape hatch
for when low-level control is needed.</li>
<li>The advantage of using <code>unsafe</code> is that it allows for memory errors to be audited easily, and it also makes it clear
which parts of the code are dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-with-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#compatibility-with-other-languages">Compatibility with Other Languages</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust offers zero overhead FFI, allowing for easy integration with C and C++ code.</li>
<li>Rust has great web assembly support and works well with traditional tools from C++, Python, and Java.</li>
<li>Rust functions can be exported through some kind of C ABI, making them callable from C.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rusts-interoperability-with-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#rusts-interoperability-with-other-languages"><a href="rust_video_summary/t=0:36:18s">#</a> Rust’s Interoperability with Other Languages</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how Rust can interact with other languages using the C ABI, and how this makes
incremental rewriting easy.</p>
<h3 id="rusts-compatibility-with-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#rusts-compatibility-with-other-languages">Rust’s Compatibility with Other Languages</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust can interact with any language that can interact with a C ABI. This includes C, C++, Java’s JNI, Go’s cgo,
Python’s C++ bindings, and Ruby.</li>
<li>Tools like bindgen and cbindgen generate Rust code or C headers for you from a given C header file or set of methods.</li>
<li>The FFI (Foreign Function Interface) makes incremental rewriting easy by allowing you to implement modules in Rust and
swap them out in your existing project.</li>
<li>Rust has good interoperability with web assembly, which is built into browsers. It also has one of the best
integrations for web assembly among programming languages.</li>
<li>Traditional tools like perf, gdb, lldb, Valgrind work on Rust binaries because it is compiled using LLVM to machine
code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependency-management-and-standard-tools"><a class="header" href="#dependency-management-and-standard-tools">Dependency Management and Standard Tools</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the built-in dependency management and standard tools that come with Rust.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-management"><a class="header" href="#dependency-management">Dependency Management</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has a built-in dependency management system called Cargo.toml.</li>
<li>The Rust compiler automatically fetches dependencies, builds them, and ensures that it builds any given dependency
only once, even if it’s transitively included by different paths.</li>
<li>The Rust toolchain knows about versioning and will let you use the most up-to-date versions of your dependencies that
your code is still compatible with.</li>
<li>You can spin up your own private repository if you have libraries or “crates” in the Rust ecosystem lingo that you
don’t want to be public to the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standard-tools"><a class="header" href="#standard-tools">Standard Tools</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust comes with standardized tools like cargo format for formatting code, cargo doc for generating documentation from
documentation comments, cargo clippy for linting, RLS and rust analyzer for IDE integration.</li>
<li>Docs.rs is a website that automatically generates all of the documentation for every version of every library uploaded
to the standard repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rusts-primary-features"><a class="header" href="#rusts-primary-features">Rust’s Primary Features</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses some of the primary features of the Rust language.</p>
<h3 id="metaprogramming-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#metaprogramming-in-rust">Metaprogramming in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has good support for writing programs that manipulate other Rust programs.</li>
<li>This is known as metaprogramming and involves manipulating the AST or syntax tree of a program.</li>
<li>Rust macros are more controlled than C++ or C macros and are fully-fledged Rust programs with well-defined syntax for
transforming Rust trees.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="procedural-macros"><a class="header" href="#procedural-macros">Procedural Macros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Procedural macros allow you to write a Rust function from a stream of tokens to a new stream of tokens.</li>
<li>This lets you do more elaborate rewritings of Rust code.</li>
<li>The “serde” library provides serialization and deserialization for any type automatically for any format using these
macros.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asynchronous-code-support"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-code-support">Asynchronous Code Support</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has built-in support for asynchronous code execution.</li>
<li>You can choose your own runtime instead of being dictated by the language like in nodejs, Go, or Java.</li>
<li>You define an executor that can take futures from the standard library and run them cooperatively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-advantages-and-drawbacks"><a class="header" href="#rust-advantages-and-drawbacks">Rust: Advantages and Drawbacks</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the advantages and drawbacks of using Rust as a programming
language.</p>
<h3 id="rust-learning-curve"><a class="header" href="#rust-learning-curve">Rust Learning Curve</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has a steep learning curve due to its unique features such as the borrowed checker.</li>
<li>The borrowed checker is a different way to reason about pointers in your program, which can be challenging to learn.</li>
<li>Although it takes longer to learn than other languages, when your program compiles, it is more likely to run
correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#ecosystem">Ecosystem</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust is a relatively young language with a small ecosystem that has few maintainers.</li>
<li>There are high-quality libraries available in the ecosystem like rayon and serde that can do things you couldn’t do in
other languages.</li>
<li>Many crates are still in early stages, so there’s some churn in the ecosystem. However, more libraries are hitting
stable releases with stable APIs that you can depend on.</li>
<li>The community is very friendly and supportive. You’ll find people willing to help if you have trouble with Rust code
or need support on a library.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="object-oriented-model"><a class="header" href="#object-oriented-model">Object-Oriented Model</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust does not have an object-oriented model like Python or C++. This can be pretty alien for those who come from these
languages.</li>
<li>Although you still have things like interfaces, they work differently than in other languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-14"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-14">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes by reiterating their goal of providing information for others
to decide whether Rust is right for them.</p>
<p>The speaker’s goal was not to tell the audience that Rust is the right language but to provide information for them to
decide whether it’s right for them. Rust has advantages such as being a performant language with zero-cost abstractions
and ensuring thread safety at compile time. However, it also has drawbacks like a steep learning curve due to its unique
features and a small ecosystem with few maintainers. Despite this, Rust is worth considering because of its friendly
community and high-quality libraries.</p>
<h2 id="rust-downsides"><a class="header" href="#rust-downsides">Rust Downsides</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses some of the downsides of using Rust.</p>
<h3 id="no-runtime-reflection"><a class="header" href="#no-runtime-reflection">No Runtime Reflection</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust’s lack of a runtime means that there is no runtime reflection.</li>
<li>In Java, you can attach to a program in the middle of executing something and use the runtime to inspect various
things about its execution. In Rust, you can’t do the same.</li>
<li>You can use gdb or lldb to try to tease out that information, but the lack of a runtime means that that information is
less rich.</li>
<li>It also means that the program can’t really introspect itself at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="longer-compile-times"><a class="header" href="#longer-compile-times">Longer Compile Times</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Because Rust is a fully compiled language and uses LLVM, there’s sort of a long pipeline to get to the final binary,
and everything has to be compiled.</li>
<li>The compile times are somewhat longer than what you might be used to in something like Python where there’s just no
compile time at all.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiling-from-source"><a class="header" href="#compiling-from-source">Compiling from Source</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In Rust, there aren’t really pre-built libraries you can download. You sort of need to compile from source.</li>
<li>If I want to call a function in your library, and your library function is generic, I need to compile the version of
your method for the type I’m using. And that type might be defined in my library. So I need the source in order to do
that compilation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vendor-support"><a class="header" href="#vendor-support">Vendor Support</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Often when working with very large software projects you have dependencies on things that you didn’t build. That were
just given to you by a vendor.</li>
<li>The FFI interface works pretty well as long as the library you get has an API that isn’t too complicated. But
sometimes, working with these large vendored things can be a bit of a pain.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you work with a vendor that has some kind of tooling that they provide when you use their library that
tooling might not work if you’re working through Rust code because they might assume that you’re just writing C++
code.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-async-functions"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-async-functions">Introduction to Async Functions</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces async functions and explains how they work.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-async-function"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-async-function">What is an Async Function?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An async function is a function that returns a future.</li>
<li>The future trait signifies a value that’s not ready yet but will eventually be of a certain type.</li>
<li>Awaiting on a future means not running the following instructions until it resolves into its output type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-async-functions-work"><a class="header" href="#how-async-functions-work">How Async Functions Work</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A future does nothing until it is awaited.</li>
<li>When awaited, the future describes a series of steps that will be executed at some point in the future.</li>
<li>If an async function calls another async function, it awaits the returned future before continuing with its own
execution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-using-async-functions"><a class="header" href="#example-of-using-async-functions">Example of Using Async Functions</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker provides an example of using async functions and explains how they can be
used to handle long-running operations.</p>
<h3 id="handling-long-running-operations"><a class="header" href="#handling-long-running-operations">Handling Long-Running Operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading from a file can take time and block other operations.</li>
<li>By using async functions, we can avoid blocking other operations while waiting for long-running tasks to complete.</li>
<li>We can use await to pause execution until the task completes without blocking other operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-code"><a class="header" href="#example-code">Example Code</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker provides an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use async functions to read from a file without
blocking other operations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-blocks"><a class="header" href="#async-blocks">Async Blocks</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains how async blocks execute in chunks and yield when they have to wait.</p>
<h3 id="async-blocks-1"><a class="header" href="#async-blocks-1">Async Blocks</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Async blocks execute in chunks.</li>
<li>They yield when they have to wait, allowing other things to run.</li>
<li>A future is checked for progress towards completion.</li>
<li>When a future makes progress, it continues executing from the last point it yielded until the next point where it
might fail to make progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mental-model-of-async"><a class="header" href="#mental-model-of-async">Mental Model of Async</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section provides a mental model of async that helps understand how async works.</p>
<h3 id="mental-model-of-async-1"><a class="header" href="#mental-model-of-async-1">Mental Model of Async</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The mental model is that async lets you chunk computation.</li>
<li>It runs until it has to wait and then yields, letting other things run.</li>
<li>Once an await resolves, execution continues as if there were no async until another future is created and awaited.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="promises-vs-futures"><a class="header" href="#promises-vs-futures">Promises vs Futures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section compares promises and futures.</p>
<h3 id="promises-vs-futures-1"><a class="header" href="#promises-vs-futures-1">Promises vs Futures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A future can be thought of as a promise in terms of the word “promise,” not in terms of the actual JavaScript type
Promise.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-async-programming-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-async-programming-in-rust">Understanding Async Programming in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how async programming works and why it is useful.</p>
<h3 id="how-async-programming-works"><a class="header" href="#how-async-programming-works">How Async Programming Works</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Async programming involves waiting for multiple operations to complete without blocking the main thread.</li>
<li>Yielding allows you to return all the way up to where a future was first awaited.</li>
<li>This approach is useful when you have many futures that you want to wait on simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-use-async-programming"><a class="header" href="#why-use-async-programming">Why Use Async Programming?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traditional threading systems require one thread for each operation, which can be difficult to manage.</li>
<li>Async programming allows you to handle multiple operations with a single thread, making it easier to manage and more
efficient.</li>
<li>Using async programming also allows you to handle slow connections without getting stuck writing to them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-16"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-16">Conclusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Async programming is a powerful tool for managing multiple operations efficiently and effectively. By using async
programming, developers can avoid the pitfalls of traditional threading systems and create more robust applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-select-macro"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-select-macro">Introduction to Select Macro</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the select macro and how it can be used with futures.</p>
<h3 id="using-select-macro-with-futures"><a class="header" href="#using-select-macro-with-futures">Using Select Macro with Futures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The select macro waits on multiple futures and tells you which one finished first.</li>
<li>If progress is made on network, then a stream is given and the code inside is called. If not, progress is tried on the
terminal.</li>
<li>When neither of them make progress, it yields and retries later using some operating system primitive under the hood
to be smarter about when it tries again.</li>
<li>Async allows you to express waiting for something else to happen while giving up thread’s time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-async-await"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-async-await">Benefits of Async Await</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how async await can be used as a state machine and its benefits.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-async-await-1"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-async-await-1">Benefits of Async Await</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Async allows something else to run instead while waiting for disk or network operations.</li>
<li>Async await can be thought of as a big state machine where there are multiple paths forward depending on what becomes
available on sockets.</li>
<li>Select operation allows branching execution but in this case, there’s no real branching.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cooperative-scheduling-and-cancellation"><a class="header" href="#cooperative-scheduling-and-cancellation">Cooperative Scheduling and Cancellation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses cooperative scheduling and cancellation in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="cooperative-scheduling"><a class="header" href="#cooperative-scheduling">Cooperative Scheduling</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>async</code> functions allow for cooperative scheduling, where execution is yielded to other tasks when a function
encounters an <code>await</code> statement.</li>
<li>The <code>select!</code> macro allows for non-blocking I/O operations by selecting the first future that completes.</li>
<li>When a future is awaited, it does not execute until it is explicitly called with an <code>await</code> statement.</li>
<li>If there are no other tasks to run, the current task will continue executing until it reaches another <code>await</code>
statement or yields control back to the scheduler.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cancellation"><a class="header" href="#cancellation">Cancellation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Futures can be cancelled by dropping them if they have not been awaited yet.</li>
<li>Once a future has been awaited, its execution cannot be cancelled directly.</li>
<li>To cancel a future’s execution, you can use the <code>select!</code> macro with a timeout value or a cancellation token.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-async-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-async-in-rust">Understanding Async in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how async works in Rust and describes the mechanisms for
cooperatively scheduling a bunch of computation by describing when under what circumstances code can make progress and
under what circumstances code can yield.</p>
<h3 id="cancellation-1"><a class="header" href="#cancellation-1">Cancellation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that cancellation is done by describing the circumstances under which you should cancel the
operation.</li>
<li>A good example of cancellation is given as a cancellation channel which is like a Tokyo sync mpsc receiver.</li>
<li>The cancel function is defined as cancel.08.</li>
<li>If we get a weight, we fall through to print line below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="racing-futures-against-each-other"><a class="header" href="#racing-futures-against-each-other">Racing Futures Against Each Other</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker proposes another name for select, which is race.</li>
<li>Whichever await can produce its result first gets to run while the other one does not.</li>
<li>If we get a weight, we return zero and don’t execute any of the remainder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-executors"><a class="header" href="#understanding-executors">Understanding Executors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An executor provides both the lowest level resources like network sockets and timers and also the executor loop at the
top.</li>
<li>At some point in your program, you’re going to have this giant future that holds the entire execution of your program
but it’s a future so nothing runs yet right?</li>
<li>You’re only allowed to await in async functions and async blocks so this wouldn’t actually compile if this was an
async fn but then you see compiler complaints main function is not allowed to be async because ultimately at some
point in your program you’re going to have this giant future that holds the entire execution of your program.</li>
<li>The executor crate provides both the lowest level resources like network sockets and timers and also the executor loop
at the top.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="epoll-loop"><a class="header" href="#epoll-loop">Epoll Loop</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An executor is a sort of primitive executor that just pulls futures in a loop and does nothing else it just keeps
retrying aggressively instead.</li>
<li>Imagine that you’re doing a read from the network and you call dot await what’s going to actually happen is Tokyo’s
tcp stream is going to do a read from the network realize that I can’t read yet and then it’s going to sort of store
its file descriptor store the socket id if you will into the executor’s sort of internal state.</li>
<li>The main executor takes all those resources that it knows it needs to wait for, sends them to the operating system,
puts itself to sleep but wakes up if any of these change because it has more work to do.
I’m sorry, but I cannot provide a summary of the transcript without having access to it. Please provide me with the

other operating system event loops.</p>
<h3 id="tokyos-use-of-event-loops-1"><a class="header" href="#tokyos-use-of-event-loops-1">Tokyo’s Use of Event Loops</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:47:15s"></a> Tokyo does not re-implement kq but instead uses the Mayo crate to abstract over kq and other operating
system event loops.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:47:45s"></a> The Mayo crate allows you to register events with the operating system and go to sleep until any of
those events occur. The operating system will then wake you up when one of those events happens.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:48:49s"></a> You can use the Futures channel with Tokyo because they use the same underlying mechanisms that Rust

<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how select works in a loop and what happens if an abandoned select arm has side
effects.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-among-options-in-a-loop-1"><a class="header" href="#selecting-among-options-in-a-loop-1">Selecting Among Options in a Loop</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:49:27s"></a> When using select, it selects among all given options every time. It doesn’t remember anything about
having been run in the past.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:50:18s"></a> To reuse network across multiple iterations of the loop, you need to do something like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>let mut network = network;

    _ = foo =&gt; { ... },
    _ = &amp;mut network =&gt; { ... },

<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:51:09s"></a> If an abandoned select arm has side effects, such as file copying, it will still execute those side
effects even if it is not selected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="select-and-cooperatively-scheduled-world"><a class="header" href="#select-and-cooperatively-scheduled-world">Select and Cooperatively Scheduled World</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the potential issues that arise when using select in an asynchronous context.
It also explains the importance of cooperatively scheduling tasks to avoid blocking other futures.</p>
<h3 id="potential-issues-with-select"><a class="header" href="#potential-issues-with-select">Potential Issues with Select</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When using select, it’s possible to be in a state where some bytes have been copied from one future to another but not
all, which can lead to errors if not handled properly.</li>
<li>If a future is partially completed and then dropped, it won’t get to finish its work and will be cancelled. This means
that your program might be in an intermediate state that needs to be considered.</li>
<li>You need to be careful about what happens if one branch runs and then another branch completes so the first branch
didn’t run to completion but the second branch did where does that leave you? This is an error case that you need to
be concerned about when you’re using select.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importance-of-cooperatively-scheduling-tasks"><a class="header" href="#importance-of-cooperatively-scheduling-tasks">Importance of Cooperatively Scheduling Tasks</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In an asynchronous context, it’s important for tasks to yield occasionally so that other things can run as well. If a
future never yields, it can block other futures from making progress.</li>
<li>Using blocking operations (operations that aren’t aware of async yielding or very compute-intensive operations) can
cause threads to block and prevent other futures from making progress. It’s important to use methods
like <code>spawn_blocking</code> or <code>block_in_place</code> in Tokyo for long-blocking operations so that the executor knows how to
handle them appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-polling"><a class="header" href="#future-polling">Future Polling</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses whether select with a huge number of cases will potentially slow down by trying
all options out every time.</p>
<h3 id="future-polling-and-select"><a class="header" href="#future-polling-and-select">Future Polling and Select</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of select determines whether a select with a huge number of cases will be slowed down by trying all
options out every time.</li>
<li>In general, if you have a select with a million cases, it seems like it would be slow. However, the answer depends on
the implementation of select.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="select-macro-and-its-implementation"><a class="header" href="#select-macro-and-its-implementation">Select Macro and its Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about the select macro and how it can be implemented to optimize
for few cases rather than many cases. The speaker also explains how select can integrate with Rust machinery for dealing
with futures and wakeups.</p>
<h3 id="smart-select"><a class="header" href="#smart-select">Smart Select</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The select macro can be smart in the sense of only polling the ones that might be able to make progress.</li>
<li>When a future becomes runnable through whatever mechanism like a file descriptor was ready or a send happened on an
in-memory channel, there’s a way for the select macro to sort of inject itself into that notification that this future
is ready and sort of get a signal to update its own state when that happens.</li>
<li>The select keeps almost like a bit mask across all of its branches, and when that notification comes in, it flips the
bit for the appropriate branch. Then, next time the select is awaited, it’ll only check the ones where the bit is set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fairness-of-select-macro"><a class="header" href="#fairness-of-select-macro">Fairness of Select Macro</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It depends on which implementation you use. For example, if you look at the futures crate, it has a select biased
variant that always runs if multiple are ready; it runs the first one so that would not be fair.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuse"><a class="header" href="#fuse">Fuse</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fuse is a way to say that it’s safe to pull or await a future even if that future has already completed in the past.</li>
<li>In general, you will want to select on mutable references to futures rather than on futures themselves because if you
await on futures directly then they would just be dropped at end of selection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asynchronous-io-and-the-benefits-of-async"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-io-and-the-benefits-of-async">Asynchronous IO and the Benefits of Async</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the benefits of using async in Rust, particularly for IO-bound tasks.</p>
<h3 id="async-keyword"><a class="header" href="#async-keyword">Async Keyword</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding the <code>async</code> keyword to a function that implements matrix multiplication does not make it more expensive.</li>
<li>The code runs the same way but is wrapped in a future type, which requires waiting for results with <code>await</code>.</li>

<h3 id="overhead-of-asynchronous-io-read"><a class="header" href="#overhead-of-asynchronous-io-read">Overhead of Asynchronous IO Read</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There is some overhead when doing an asynchronous IO read compared to synchronous IO read.</li>

<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how join operations work in Rust and their usefulness when waiting for multiple
futures to complete.</p>
<h3 id="example-waiting-for-multiple-files"><a class="header" href="#example-waiting-for-multiple-files">Example: Waiting for Multiple Files</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An example scenario where join operations are useful is when waiting for multiple files to complete before continuing
with a program.</li>
<li>The join operation waits until all futures complete before continuing with the program.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="join-macro"><a class="header" href="#join-macro">Join Macro</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the futures crate, there is a join macro that lists all futures you want to wait on without specifying branches.</li>
<li>It looks similar to select macro except you don’t specify branches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wrapping-into-future-type"><a class="header" href="#wrapping-into-future-type">Wrapping into Future Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can construct a select manually too but it’s usually more hassle.</li>
<li>Select expands into basically a loop with a match or a bunch of ifs.</li>
<li>You could make select a future by wrapping it in an async block and assigning that to a variable.</li>

<h3 id="return-value"><a class="header" href="#return-value">Return Value</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Join doesn’t return anything meaningful apart from a future.</li>

<h3 id="using-join-macro"><a class="header" href="#using-join-macro">Using Join Macro</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The join macro allows operations to continue concurrently, which is more efficient.</li>
<li>It lets you overlap compute and I/O.</li>
<li>You need to explicitly enumerate all the things you’re joining.</li>
<li>There are multiple functions like join which joins two things joint three joint four joint five etc.</li>

operations concurrently.</p>
<h3 id="how-futures-work"><a class="header" href="#how-futures-work">How Futures Work</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The output of a future describes which input it was from, making it more efficient.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="concurrency-vs-parallelism"><a class="header" href="#concurrency-vs-parallelism">Concurrency vs Parallelism</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Only one thread can await one future at any time because awaiting a future requires an immutable reference to it.
Multiple threads cannot do it.</li>
<li>Even if you use multiple threads, all operations are still happening concurrently on one thread, which is not what you
want for optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-writing-a-web-server"><a class="header" href="#example-writing-a-web-server">Example: Writing a Web Server</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re writing a web server and have a loop over accepting TCP connections, using futures unordered will not give

<h3 id="using-futures-stream-and-select"><a class="header" href="#using-futures-stream-and-select">Using Futures Stream and Select</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker creates a <code>let mute connections</code> variable that is a <code>futures stream future maybe futures unordered new</code>.</li>
<li>The speaker then uses <code>select</code> to either get a new stream or call an async function called <code>handle connection</code>.</li>
<li>If there are new streams, the speaker pushes them into the <code>connections</code> variable
using <code>connections.push(handle connection of stream)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="awaiting-on-futures"><a class="header" href="#awaiting-on-futures">Awaiting on Futures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The async function <code>handle connection</code> takes a TCP stream and does something with it.</li>
<li>To ensure all futures run concurrently, the speaker needs to await on both the accepting and client connections.</li>
<li>However, having only one top-level future means that even if there are many threads, only one thread can run at a
time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introducing-parallelism-with-spawn"><a class="header" href="#introducing-parallelism-with-spawn">Introducing Parallelism with Spawn</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To introduce parallelism, the speaker gets rid of the <code>connections</code> variable and replaces it with a while loop.</li>
<li>The speaker then uses Tokio’s provided function called spawn which gives additional futures to work on.</li>
<li>This allows for two separate futures which means that two threads can run them at the same time.</li>

<h3 id="passing-data-with-tokyo-spawn"><a class="header" href="#passing-data-with-tokyo-spawn">Passing Data with Tokyo Spawn</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To share data between two things that are spawned and want them both accessing a vector, use arc new mutex new.</li>

<h3 id="advantages-of-spawning-futures"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-spawning-futures">Advantages of Spawning Futures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Spawning a future allows other tasks on the current thread to keep running while that operation is running elsewhere.</li>

want to block async execution of a thread.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Thread locals are used by Tokio to make the interface slightly nicer.</li>

<h2 id="what-is-a-future"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-future">What is a Future?</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what a future is and how it works in an async function.</p>
<ul>
<li>A future is a chunked computation with weights in between each chunk.</li>
<li>Each chunk contains the state for that part of the state machine.</li>
<li>Local variables that need to be kept across await points are saved as part of the state.</li>
<li>The compiler generates an enum-like structure to represent the state machine.</li>
<li>The future itself needs to be stored somewhere because it holds a reference into x.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-async-function"><a class="header" href="#example-async-function">Example Async Function</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker provides an example async function and explains how it gets divided up
into chunks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The async function has one chunk that starts at its beginning and ends before any await points.</li>
<li>Between each chunk is a weight operation represented by an await point.</li>
<li>Local variables that need to be kept across await points are saved as part of the state.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-impul-futures"><a class="header" href="#understanding-impul-futures">Understanding Impul Futures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how Impul futures work and how they are implemented in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="impul-future-type"><a class="header" href="#impul-future-type">Impul Future Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An <code>Impul Future</code> is a type that returns an <code>Impul Future</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>Impul Future</code> is actually a type of state machine.</li>
<li>The state machine contains all the values kept across await points.</li>
<li>When we await an <code>Impul Future</code>, we are invoking a method on the state machine type that gets an exclusive reference
immutable reference to that type so it can access the future and continue to wait.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="state-machine-type"><a class="header" href="#state-machine-type">State Machine Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The generated state machine type is a trait with a name but no specified name.</li>
<li>It contains internal local variables and references to other futures.</li>
<li>This conversion from async fn rewrites these variables as references into the state machine struct that we pass
around.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="passing-futures-around"><a class="header" href="#passing-futures-around">Passing Futures Around</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Futures can get really large because they contain all of the futures they in turn await.</li>
<li>Passing them around requires mem copying which can be expensive for large futures.</li>
<li>Boxing your features solves this problem by placing them on the heap or using box pin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-tokyo-spawn"><a class="header" href="#using-tokyo-spawn">Using Tokyo Spawn</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using something like Tokyo spawn is useful because it stores only a pointer to the future instead of storing the
entire future itself.</li>
<li>This reduces mem copies and avoids having futures grow indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-8"><a class="header" href="#introduction-8">Introduction</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>The speaker briefly discusses why futures can be moved even though they may need to be pinned.</li>
<li>The speaker explains that it is possible to create a vector of futures recursively within an async function by using a
join handle.</li>
<li>However, the speaker notes that using a vector is not enough because an array needs to know the size of its elements,
which may not be known for all futures.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that there is an async trait crate available for writing asynchronous functions within traits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-trait"><a class="header" href="#async-trait">Async Trait</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the limitations of writing asynchronous functions within traits
in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="key-points-1"><a class="header" href="#key-points-1">Key Points</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that currently, it is not possible to define an async function within a trait in Rust.</li>
<li>This is because the size of the future returned by the function cannot be determined at compile time.</li>
<li>The speaker provides an example where defining an async function within a trait would result in an error due to
unknown future size.</li>
<li>The speaker mentions that there are two ways around this limitation: using existential types or using the async trait
crate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-trait-and-associated-types"><a class="header" href="#async-trait-and-associated-types">Async Trait and Associated Types</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the use of async trait and associated types in Rust
programming. They explain how async trait works for higher-level functions but may not work well at the bottom of a
stack due to heap allocation and dynamic dispatch.</p>
<h3 id="async-trait-vs-associated-types"><a class="header" href="#async-trait-vs-associated-types">Async Trait vs. Associated Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Async trait rewrites signatures and bodies into an async move, which works if you remove async trait.</li>
<li>Rust already knows how to reason about dynamically dispatched futures, making it easy to await them.</li>
<li>Heap allocating all futures leads to dynamic dispatch, indirection, and memory allocator pressure.</li>
<li>Async trade is best suited for higher-level functions as opposed to lower-level ones like reads that require frequent
heap allocations.</li>
<li>Declaring an associated type call future can help solve the problem of heap allocation by allowing callers to know how
large the actual type is.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming-associated-types"><a class="header" href="#naming-associated-types">Naming Associated Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The challenge with using associated types is naming them since there are no clear conventions on how to do so.</li>

design decisions that need to be made before this can happen.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-code-generation"><a class="header" href="#compiler-code-generation">Compiler Code Generation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The rust compiler could theoretically generate code automatically behind the scenes when writing async functions in
traits.</li>
<li>There is a lot of magic involved in the process, and it’s not always clear how to name types that aren’t pin box.</li>
<li>Async functions and traits are likely to be implemented eventually in Rust, but there are still many design decisions
that need to be made.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker discusses different topics related to asynchronous programming such as join, futures unordered, spawn,
number of worker threads, async trait, spawn blocking, send and static futures pin and box futures.</li>
<li>Blocking code is problematic because it doesn’t let other tasks run.</li>
<li>There is an argument ongoing about whether to use the standard library mutex or an asynchronously enabled mutex. Using
a standard library mutex can lead to deadlock situations where the executor’s one thread is blocked. On the other
hand, using an asynchronously enabled mutex yields when it fails to take the lock which lets other future run again.</li>

<ul>
<li>Standard library mutexes can lead to deadlock situations where the executor’s one thread is blocked while using an
asynchronously enabled mutex yields when it fails to take the lock which lets other future run again.</li>
<li>Async-enabled mutexes are necessary for sharing state between two futures. If two asynchronous threads access the same
arc and use a standard library mutex then they may end up in deadlock situations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="standard-library-mutex-vs-async-aware-mutex"><a class="header" href="#standard-library-mutex-vs-async-aware-mutex">Standard Library Mutex vs Async-Aware Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a standard library mutex for short critical sections without await points.</li>
<li>Use an async-aware mutex if the critical section is long or contains await points to avoid blocking other futures on
other threads.</li>
<li>Standard library mutexes can be faster to acquire and release than async-aware mutexes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deadlock-potential"><a class="header" href="#deadlock-potential">Deadlock Potential</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Critical sections with await points are ripe for deadlock potential.</li>

<ul>
<li>Spawns a new operating system thread that runs in parallel with everything else in your program.</li>
<li>Does not take a future but takes a closure instead.</li>

<h3 id="awaiting-inside-a-future"><a class="header" href="#awaiting-inside-a-future">Awaiting Inside a Future</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a future yields, it just yields to whatever awaited it.</li>
<li>If inside of f you await and then you end up yielding you just go back up to b and it’s up to b what happens at this
point right b in this case is chosen to await.</li>
<li>All the way up the stack it’s going to be awaits all the way up to the executor which does have the option of
rescheduling you on a different thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="single-threaded-executors"><a class="header" href="#single-threaded-executors">Single Threaded Executors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a single threaded executor it would execute on that same thread because there are no other threads in
Tokyo.</li>
<li>You’re not guaranteed that it’s the same thread; there are ways to say only run me on one thread in different
executors like in Tokyo there’s like a spawn local which gives you some of these guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enforcing-static-guarantees"><a class="header" href="#enforcing-static-guarantees">Enforcing Static Guarantees</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you really wanted a future not to be sent across threads, you would just not implement send for it. Of course, that

<ul>
<li>If you print just a regular stack trace inside of an async inside of a future, you will get the call trace going up to
the executor.</li>
<li>The problem really stems from spawning. If I spawn this future and then let’s say I panicked right here then this
panic would not show main.</li>
<li>When that executor thread awaits this future and it panics, the backtrace for that panic will only say the executor
pulled this future so it’ll point you at this future but that trace.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-10"><a class="header" href="#introduction-10">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this video, the speaker will explain atomics and memory ordering. The speaker has been hesitant to tackle this topic because of the lack of documentation and complexity of the subject. However, after working with it enough, he feels confident in giving a correct and understandable explanation.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-atomics"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-atomics">Why Do We Need Atomics?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a primitive type like bool or usize that is shared across thread boundaries, there are only certain ways to interact with that value that are safe.</li>
<li>It makes sense to have slightly different APIs for atomic types because you’re issuing different instructions to the underlying CPU and placing different limitations on what code the compiler is allowed to generate.</li>
<li>When you have shared access to some memory value, you need additional information about that access to let the CPU know when should different threads see the operations that other threads do.</li>
<li>Rust’s standard sync atomic model has good documentation on high-level ideas of why we have these types and what they’re used for.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-will-be-covered"><a class="header" href="#what-will-be-covered">What Will Be Covered?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The stream will be Rust-specific but most of it translates to any other language that has atomics in this kind of sense.</li>
<li>The core focus will be on Rust’s atomic types and memory ordering observed in Rust.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-types"><a class="header" href="#atomic-types">Atomic Types</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains why using primitive types like bool or usize can lead to undefined behavior when shared across thread boundaries. It also explains how atomic types provide additional information about shared access to memory values.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-use-primitive-types"><a class="header" href="#why-not-use-primitive-types">Why Not Use Primitive Types?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are only certain ways to interact with primitive types safely when they are shared across thread boundaries.</li>
<li>Data races are undefined behavior, so if you don’t control how different threads interoperate on the same memory location, you run into undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Atomic types provide additional information about shared access to memory values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-atomic-types"><a class="header" href="#what-are-atomic-types">What Are Atomic Types?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When operating on atomic versions of primitive types, you’re issuing different instructions to the underlying CPU and placing different limitations on what code the compiler is allowed to generate.</li>
<li>You need additional information about shared access to memory values to let the CPU know when should different threads see the operations that other threads do.</li>

<p>Section Overview: The speaker concludes by summarizing why atomics are necessary and what will be covered in this video. He also emphasizes that understanding memory ordering is useful regardless of what language you’re working in.</p>
<h3 id="key-takeaways"><a class="header" href="#key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a primitive type like bool or usize that is shared across thread boundaries, there are only certain ways to interact with that value that are safe.</li>

<h2 id="rust-memory-model"><a class="header" href="#rust-memory-model">Rust Memory Model</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about the Rust memory model and how it is not yet fully defined. They also introduce the Rust reference as a source of information for implementing a Rust compiler.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-memory-model"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-memory-model">Introduction to Memory Model</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Rust language does not have a fully defined memory model yet.</li>
<li>Various proposals are being worked on by academics and industry professionals.</li>
<li>This can be unhelpful when writing code that uses atomics and concurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memory-ordering-documentation"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-documentation">Memory Ordering Documentation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker will be using the memory ordering documentation from C++ as it has good explanations and examples of different memory orderings.</li>
<li>This page will be used for explanations, examples, and guarantees throughout the talk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="atomic-types-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#atomic-types-in-rust">Atomic Types in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Atomic types in Rust are not inherently shared and need to be placed on the heap using something like <code>Box</code> or <code>Arc</code>.</li>
<li>This allows sharing a pointer or reference to that atomic value which can then be updated.</li>
<li>The main differentiator between atomic types and regular types is that atomic types can be operated on using shared references to self.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods-for-atomic-use-size-type"><a class="header" href="#methods-for-atomic-use-size-type">Methods for Atomic Use Size Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are several methods available for operating on an atomic use size type, including load, store, swap, compare_and_swap, fetch_add/sub/and/or/xor/nand.</li>
<li>Load returns the value stored in the atomic use size type while store takes a value and stores it into the type.</li>
<li>Swap performs both operations at once by returning the old value while storing a new one.</li>
<li>Compare_and_swap compares the current value with an expected value and if they match, replaces it with a new one. Otherwise, it returns the current value without modifying it.</li>
<li>Fetch_add/sub/and/or/xor/nand performs the corresponding operation on the value stored in the atomic use size type and returns the old value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-memory-ordering"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-memory-ordering">Introduction to Memory Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces memory ordering and its importance in multi-threaded programming. They also introduce some methods for reading and swapping values atomically.</p>
<h3 id="memory-ordering-and-guarantees"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-and-guarantees">Memory Ordering and Guarantees</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory ordering tells the compiler which set of guarantees you expect for a particular memory access with respect to things that might be happening in other threads at the same time.</li>
<li>There are different types of guarantees provided by memory ordering, such as acquire, release, and sequentially consistent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="atomic-operations"><a class="header" href="#atomic-operations">Atomic Operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Atomic operations allow multiple threads to operate on a value at the same time in a well-defined way without locking.</li>
<li>Compare-and-swap is an atomic operation that reads a value and swaps it out conditionally in one atomic step. It ensures no thread can get between the load and store operations.</li>
<li>Fetch methods like fetch-add or fetch-sub are similar to compare-and-swap but perform arithmetic operations instead of conditional swaps. They also ensure no thread can execute between load and store operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-from-viewers"><a class="header" href="#questions-from-viewers">Questions from Viewers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-exhaustive means that no code is allowed to assume that these are all the variants that will ever be in ordering so if you match on an ordering, you always need to include an underscore branch in an otherwise or else branch because the standard library wants to be able to add additional orderings later if necessary.</li>
<li>The different orderings are related to what guarantees the operation gives you; how different architectures implement those guarantees will vary from architecture to architecture as we’ll see later on.</li>
<li>Mutex guards a larger section of code while atomic guards just a single memory access if needed but more efficiently than mutexes would.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how atomic types work in Rust and why they are considered lock-free.</p>
<h3 id="atomic-operations-and-compiler-semantics"><a class="header" href="#atomic-operations-and-compiler-semantics">Atomic Operations and Compiler Semantics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:16:28"></a> Atomic types in Rust are considered lock-free because they do not use mutexes.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:16:51"></a> Atomic operations limit both what the CPU can do and what the compiler can do about a given memory access.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:17:08"></a> Even on architectures like Intel x86 64, it is still recommended to use atomic types because they provide guarantees from the compiler as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unsafe-cell-and-atomic-instructions"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-cell-and-atomic-instructions">Unsafe Cell and Atomic Instructions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:17:45"></a> The store swap and friends all take an immutable reference to self, which means they rely on unsafe cell.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:18:09"></a> All of these atomic instructions contain an unsafe cell that they then call get on to get the pointer to the value.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:18:30"></a> The atomic type macro expands to a struct definition that holds an unsafe cell of the inner type.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sharing-atomics-with-arc"><a class="header" href="#sharing-atomics-with-arc"><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:19:07">#</a> Sharing Atomics with Arc</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses why atomics are generally shared via Arc rather than Box.</p>
<h3 id="using-arc-for-static-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#using-arc-for-static-lifetime">Using Arc for Static Lifetime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:19:27"></a> When spawning two threads, both require that the closure you pass in has a static lifetime.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:19:49"></a> With an Arc, you can clone it and give each thread its own individually owned and therefore static Arc to the atomic usize.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-approach-with-box-leak"><a class="header" href="#alternative-approach-with-box-leak">Alternative Approach with Box Leak</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:20.08s"></a> Box leak will leak a value on the heap so it will never call the destructor which gives you back a static reference which you can then pass to both threads.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:21:13"></a> A mutex is a combination of a boolean that marks whether or not someone currently holds the lock and then an unsafe cell to the inner type.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:21:43"></a> The implementation requires Sync Atomic and Atomic Bool.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-mutexes"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-mutexes">Introduction to Mutexes</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces mutexes and explains why spin locks should not be used.</p>
<h3 id="naive-implementation-of-mutex"><a class="header" href="#naive-implementation-of-mutex">Naive Implementation of Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker creates a new method for the mutex.</li>
<li>The method takes an initial value to create the mutex with.</li>
<li>Constants are created to make the code more readable.</li>
<li>The speaker explains how the naive implementation of mutex works using a while loop that spins until the lock is no longer held.</li>
<li>The function captures return value, sets it back to unlocked, and returns red.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-naive-implementation"><a class="header" href="#problems-with-naive-implementation">Problems with Naive Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The code does not compile because an argument is missing in the method.</li>
<li>Ordering is required in this method but it’s not clear what ordering should be used yet. For now, relaxed ordering will be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-mutex"><a class="header" href="#testing-mutex">Testing Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A lock mutex is created and five threads are spawned to modify its value at the same time through the lock.</li>
<li>Each thread uses l.with_lock() and adds 1 to v a hundred times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-a-mutex"><a class="header" href="#implementing-a-mutex">Implementing a Mutex</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to implement a mutex in Rust using atomics and compare-and-swap operations.</p>
<h3 id="collecting-thread-handles"><a class="header" href="#collecting-thread-handles">Collecting Thread Handles</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We collect all thread handles so that we can wait for them afterwards.</li>
<li>We spin up 10 threads, each of which increments the value 100 times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sync-for-mutex"><a class="header" href="#sync-for-mutex">Sync for Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Unsafe cell cannot be shared between threads safely.</li>
<li>Mutex is sync for mutex t where t is send.</li>
<li>We implement sync from mutex so that you can concurrently access it from multiple threads as long as the value t is send.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-mutex-implementation"><a class="header" href="#problems-with-mutex-implementation">Problems with Mutex Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The reason we need atomics and why we need operations like compare and swap is because here we’re doing a load and then we’re doing a store but in between here maybe another thread runs.</li>
<li>It’s possible for two threads to execute the closure passed to with lock at the same time, leading to undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-concurrency-issues"><a class="header" href="#understanding-concurrency-issues">Understanding Concurrency Issues</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the issues that arise when multiple threads are running concurrently and accessing shared memory.</p>
<h3 id="concurrency-issues-with-multiple-cores"><a class="header" href="#concurrency-issues-with-multiple-cores">Concurrency Issues with Multiple Cores</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When different threads run on different cores, there is no control over the relative operations of each thread.</li>
<li>The operating system limits how long a given thread gets to run for and may forcibly stop a program in the middle to ensure all threads get to run.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="race-conditions-and-preemption"><a class="header" href="#race-conditions-and-preemption">Race Conditions and Preemption</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Preemption can occur at any point in time, including between a load and store operation.</li>
<li>A race condition occurs when two threads observe the mutex being unlocked at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solving-concurrency-issues-with-compare-exchange-operation"><a class="header" href="#solving-concurrency-issues-with-compare-exchange-operation">Solving Concurrency Issues with Compare Exchange Operation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compare exchange operation is used to avoid race conditions between multiple threads accessing shared memory.</li>
<li>Compare exchange is more powerful than compare and swap because it strictly avoids race conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-of-compare-exchange"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-compare-exchange">Overview of Compare Exchange</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how compare exchange works and why it is useful.</p>
<h3 id="how-compare-exchange-works"><a class="header" href="#how-compare-exchange-works">How Compare Exchange Works</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>compare_exchange</code> takes the current value, new value, and two orderings.</li>
<li>The first line of documentation stores a value into the atomic integer or boolean if the current value is the same as the current value.</li>
<li>If the CPU looks at the atomic bool and sees that it is unlocked (false), then it sets it to true in such a way that no other thread gets to modify the value in between when we look at it and when we change it.</li>
<li>Compare exchange is a single operation that is both read and write.</li>
<li>It can be done in a loop because if the current value is locked, then compare exchange will return an error.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-compare-exchange-is-useful"><a class="header" href="#why-compare-exchange-is-useful">Why Compare Exchange Is Useful</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Compare exchange solves this particular problem because there’s no space in between load and store; they’re just one operation performed on memory location.</li>
<li>However, compare exchange can be expensive because every CPU spins during compare exchange.</li>
<li>CPUs need to coordinate exclusive access amongst all these cores which can be inefficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compare-exchange-and-spin-locks"><a class="header" href="#compare-exchange-and-spin-locks">Compare Exchange and Spin Locks</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the differences between compare exchange and spin locks, and how to optimize spin locks for high contention.</p>
<h3 id="compare-exchange-vs-spin-locks"><a class="header" href="#compare-exchange-vs-spin-locks">Compare Exchange vs. Spin Locks</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In compare exchange, the CPU requires exclusive access to a location in memory, which requires coordination with everyone else.</li>
<li>A given location of memory can be marked as shared, allowing multiple cores to have a value in the shared state at the same time.</li>
<li>Compare exchange is much faster than locking a mutex because it will never wait. A single compare exchange call will try to do the operation you told it and then say either “I succeeded” or “I failed”. If it fails, it does not block the thread.</li>
<li>The biggest difference between compare exchange and a mutex is that a mutex has to wait while a compare exchange will never wait.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optimizing-spin-locks-for-high-contention"><a class="header" href="#optimizing-spin-locks-for-high-contention">Optimizing Spin Locks for High Contention</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we can have a value stay in the shared state while the lock is still held, that’s going to avoid all of the ownership bouncing.</li>
<li>Certain spin lock implementations use an inner loop that only reads values if they fail to take the lock. This allows values to stay in the shared state until some core takes exclusive access to them.</li>
<li>When there is high contention on a particular value with many threads or cores fighting over who gets exclusive access, performance may collapse. Avoiding this collapse by optimizing spin locks can lead to better performance curves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compare-exchange-weak"><a class="header" href="#compare-exchange-weak">Compare Exchange Weak</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains what compare exchange weak is and how it differs from regular compare exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare exchange weak is allowed to fail spuriously, even if the current value is what you passed in. Regular compare exchange is only allowed to fail if the current value did not match the value you passed in.</li>
<li>The difference between these two operations comes down to what operations the CPU supports. On Intel x86, there is a compare and swap operation that effectively implements compare exchange.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="load-exclusive-and-store-exclusive"><a class="header" href="#load-exclusive-and-store-exclusive">Load Exclusive and Store Exclusive</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the difference between compare and swap operations on x86 and ARM processors.</p>
<h3 id="load-exclusive-and-store-exclusive-1"><a class="header" href="#load-exclusive-and-store-exclusive-1">Load Exclusive and Store Exclusive</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>On ARM processors, instead of a compare and swap operation, there is a load exclusive (ldrex) and store exclusive (strex) operation.</li>
<li>Load exclusive takes exclusive ownership of the memory location and loads the value to you.</li>
<li>Store exclusive only works if you still have exclusive access to that location. If another thread has taken ownership of the value, it will fail.</li>
<li>Compare exchange on ARM is implemented using a loop of ldrex and strex because it needs to implement the semantics of comparexchange which is only fail if the current value stayed the same.</li>
<li>Compare exchange weak is allowed to fail spuriously so it can be implemented directly using ldrx and strx.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-ordering"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering">Memory Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how memory ordering affects observable behavior when multiple threads interact with a shared memory location.</p>
<h3 id="ordering-variants"><a class="header" href="#ordering-variants">Ordering Variants</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are different variants for ordering: relaxed, release, acquire, acquire-release, sequential consistency.</li>
<li>Relaxed means there are no guarantees about what happens when multiple threads interact with a shared memory location.</li>
<li>Release ensures that all previous writes become visible before any subsequent write or read from another thread occurs.</li>
<li>Acquire ensures that all previous reads become visible before any subsequent read or write from another thread occurs.</li>
<li>Acquire-release combines both acquire and release semantics.</li>
<li>Sequential consistency ensures that all operations appear to execute in a total order.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-barriers"><a class="header" href="#memory-barriers">Memory Barriers</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses memory barriers and how they can be used to enforce ordering constraints.</p>
<h3 id="memory-barriers-1"><a class="header" href="#memory-barriers-1">Memory Barriers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory barriers are instructions that enforce ordering constraints on memory operations.</li>
<li>There are two types of memory barriers: compiler barriers and hardware barriers.</li>
<li>Compiler barriers prevent the compiler from reordering memory operations across the barrier.</li>
<li>Hardware barriers ensure that all previous memory operations have completed before any subsequent operation is executed.</li>
<li>The C++11 standard defines several types of hardware barriers, including acquire, release, and full.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="happens-before-relationship"><a class="header" href="#happens-before-relationship">Happens-Before Relationship</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the happens-before relationship and how it relates to observable behavior when multiple threads interact with shared memory locations.</p>
<h3 id="happens-before-relationship-1"><a class="header" href="#happens-before-relationship-1">Happens-Before Relationship</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The happens-before relationship is a partial order between events in a program that determines what values can be observed by other threads.</li>
<li>If event A happens before event B, then any value written by A must be visible to B.</li>
<li>If there is no happens-before relationship between two events, then their order is undefined.</li>
<li>Synchronizes-with is a special case of happens-before where one event synchronizes with another if it releases a mutex or semaphore that another thread acquires later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lock-free-programming"><a class="header" href="#lock-free-programming">Lock-Free Programming</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses lock-free programming and its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="lock-free-programming-1"><a class="header" href="#lock-free-programming-1">Lock-Free Programming</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lock-free programming is a technique for writing concurrent programs without using locks.</li>
<li>The advantage of lock-free programming is that it can avoid the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks, which can be expensive.</li>
<li>The disadvantage of lock-free programming is that it can be more difficult to reason about and debug than lock-based programming.</li>
<li>Lock-free programming requires careful attention to memory ordering constraints and the happens-before relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relaxed-ordering-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#relaxed-ordering-in-rust">Relaxed Ordering in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how relaxed ordering works in Rust and why it can lead to unexpected results.</p>
<h3 id="relaxed-ordering-and-thread-execution"><a class="header" href="#relaxed-ordering-and-thread-execution">Relaxed Ordering and Thread Execution</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker spawns two threads and creates an atomic variable x with size 0.</li>
<li>The speaker creates another atomic variable y with size 0.</li>
<li>Box leak returns a static mutable reference which cannot be moved into two threads. Therefore, the speaker casts it as an atomic variable.</li>
<li>The speaker creates two threads, x and y, both of which are numbers.</li>
<li>Thread 1 reads y with relaxed ordering and stores that value into x.</li>
<li>Thread 2 loads x and then stores 42 into y.</li>
<li>Both threads are joined so that we have the values t2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explanation-of-relaxed-ordering"><a class="header" href="#explanation-of-relaxed-ordering">Explanation of Relaxed Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is possible for r1 to be equal to r2 be equal to 42. This is a possible execution of this program.</li>
<li>When multiple threads execute concurrently by default there are no guarantees about what values a thread can read from something another thread wrote under ordering relaxed.</li>
<li>There is a modification order stored per value in atomic operations. When you load a value with ordering relaxed you can see any value written by any thread to that location there’s no restriction on when that has to happen relative to you.</li>
<li>For example, when loading a value from x, it is allowed to see any value ever stored to x including 42 because it’s in the modification set of x and there are no constraints on which subset of that which range of that modification order is visible to this thread.</li>
<li>The compiler is totally allowed to reorder these two operations. Similarly, the CPU is allowed to execute them out of order for optimization purposes.</li>
<li>Under either of these conditions, the reverse execution might happen and if the code looks like this it’s totally obvious why r2 might be 42. With ordering relaxed you’re not guaranteed any ordering between threads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reordering-and-speculative-execution"><a class="header" href="#reordering-and-speculative-execution">Reordering and Speculative Execution</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how reordering makes sense in programming and how CPUs can execute operations speculatively. They also explain the constraints on what CPUs and compilers are allowed to reorder.</p>
<h3 id="reordering-in-programming"><a class="header" href="#reordering-in-programming">Reordering in Programming</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reordering lines of code that don’t depend on each other can make sense for programmers.</li>
<li>There is no downside to swapping two lines of code that don’t depend on each other.</li>
<li>Observable execution outcomes are different, but in the case of relaxed memory ordering, they’re interchangeable as far as the memory ordering specification is concerned.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="speculative-execution"><a class="header" href="#speculative-execution">Speculative Execution</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CPUs can run an operation before another one if it knows it’s about to be executed. This is called speculative execution.</li>
<li>Speculative execution usually comes up when there’s a question whether an operation might be executed or not.</li>
<li>Today’s CPUs are very good at out-of-order execution because it makes programs much faster.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constraints-on-reordering"><a class="header" href="#constraints-on-reordering">Constraints on Reordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CPUs and compilers are allowed to reorder anything that doesn’t have a clear “happens before” relationship.</li>
<li>If two lines of code have a dependence relation (i.e., if one depends on the other), they cannot be reordered.</li>
<li>Memory ordering and semantics are not just about the CPU or architecture; they’re also about what the compiler is allowed to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exclusive-access-and-relaxed-memory-ordering"><a class="header" href="#exclusive-access-and-relaxed-memory-ordering">Exclusive Access and Relaxed Memory Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why relaxed memory ordering matters when taking locks with exclusive access.</p>
<h3 id="exclusive-access"><a class="header" href="#exclusive-access">Exclusive Access</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we already have exclusive access to a piece of memory, we can do an operation on it efficiently.</li>
<li>In the case of relaxed memory ordering, this can lead to shenanigans where operations are executed out of order.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relaxed-memory-ordering-and-locks"><a class="header" href="#relaxed-memory-ordering-and-locks">Relaxed Memory Ordering and Locks</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Relaxed memory ordering doesn’t imply any ordering or that anything happens before anything else.</li>
<li>When taking locks with relaxed memory ordering, operations might execute while another thread is holding the lock, violating the exclusivity of immutable reference. This is bad for both the compiler and CPU.</li>
<li>The reordering we give determines whether an operation is legal or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-orderings-and-acquiringreleasing-resources"><a class="header" href="#memory-orderings-and-acquiringreleasing-resources">Memory Orderings and Acquiring/Releasing Resources</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses memory orderings in the context of acquiring or releasing a resource. It explains how the release ordering ensures that nothing moves below the lock, and how the acquire ordering guarantees that anything that happened before the store happens before anything that happens after the load.</p>
<h3 id="store-with-release-ordering"><a class="header" href="#store-with-release-ordering">Store with Release Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A reordering is valid with relaxed, but not with release.</li>
<li>The release ordering ensures that nothing moves below the lock.</li>
<li>All previous operations become ordered before any load of this value with acquire or stronger ordering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="load-with-acquire-ordering"><a class="header" href="#load-with-acquire-ordering">Load with Acquire Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Anything we do in here must be visible after an acquire load of the same value.</li>
<li>Whoever next takes the lock must see anything that happened before this store.</li>
<li>The acquire-release pair establishes a happens-before relationship between threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#additional-restrictions">Additional Restrictions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>No reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after a store operation with memory order release.</li>
<li>A load operation with memory order acquire performs the acquire operation on the effective memory location.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-acquire-release-semantics"><a class="header" href="#understanding-acquire-release-semantics">Understanding Acquire-Release Semantics</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains acquire-release semantics and how they are used in synchronization operations.</p>
<h3 id="acquire-release-semantics"><a class="header" href="#acquire-release-semantics">Acquire-Release Semantics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquire-release semantics are used in synchronization operations that involve a read and write operation.</li>
<li>The acquire-release semantics establish ordering between threads to ensure correct synchronization.</li>
<li>Acquire-release is commonly used for single modification operations where there is no critical section.</li>
<li>Sequentially consistent ordering is stronger than acquire-release.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compare-exchange-operation"><a class="header" href="#compare-exchange-operation">Compare Exchange Operation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compare exchange operation has an extra parameter that specifies the ordering of the load if it indicates that you shouldn’t store.</li>
<li>Establishing a happens-before relationship between threads is important when taking a lock.</li>
<li>Relaxed memory semantics can be used when failing to take a lock does not require coordination with other threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-concurrent-code"><a class="header" href="#testing-concurrent-code">Testing Concurrent Code</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>x86_64 architecture guarantees acquire-release semantics for all operations, but this is not true for all platforms.</li>
<li>Testing concurrent code by running it multiple times on current hardware and compiler may not be representative of future executions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relaxed-and-strong-memory-ordering"><a class="header" href="#relaxed-and-strong-memory-ordering">Relaxed and Strong Memory Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the use of relaxed memory ordering when it doesn’t matter what each thread sees. It also introduces fetch operations as a gentler version of compare exchanges.</p>
<h3 id="relaxed-memory-ordering"><a class="header" href="#relaxed-memory-ordering">Relaxed Memory Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use relaxed memory ordering when it doesn’t matter what each thread sees.</li>
<li>For example, if you maintain a counter for statistics, you can generally have it be relaxed because the relative ordering of execution doesn’t really matter.</li>
<li>Relax imposes the least amount of restrictions on the CPU and compiler, allowing them to execute more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fetch-operations"><a class="header" href="#fetch-operations">Fetch Operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fetch operations are gentler versions of compare exchanges.</li>
<li>They allow you to tell the CPU how to compute the new value instead of just dictating what the updated value should be.</li>
<li>Fetch ad is an example where you add one to the current value and store it back without failing.</li>
<li>Fetch update takes a closure that is given the current value and should return the new value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fetch-operations-and-sequentially-consistent-ordering"><a class="header" href="#fetch-operations-and-sequentially-consistent-ordering">Fetch Operations and Sequentially Consistent Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains how fetch operations work in combination with sequentially consistent ordering.</p>
<h3 id="sequentially-consistent-ordering"><a class="header" href="#sequentially-consistent-ordering">Sequentially Consistent Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sequentially consistent ordering ensures that all threads see a consistent order of events.</li>
<li>It’s useful when there are dependencies between threads or instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fetch-operations-with-sequentially-consistent-ordering"><a class="header" href="#fetch-operations-with-sequentially-consistent-ordering">Fetch Operations with Sequentially Consistent Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When using fetch operations with sequentially consistent ordering, they behave like acquire-release semantics.</li>
<li>The operation has both an acquire effect on any previous memory accesses by other threads and a release effect on any subsequent memory accesses by other threads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-fetch-operations"><a class="header" href="#understanding-fetch-operations">Understanding Fetch Operations</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what fetch operations are and how they work.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-update"><a class="header" href="#fetch-update">Fetch Update</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch_update</code> loads the current value and does a compare exchange in a loop.</li>
<li>It is not the same as other fetch operations because it uses a compare exchange loop.</li>
<li>Atomic types in Rust’s atomic module are guaranteed to be lock-free if available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unique-sequence-numbers"><a class="header" href="#unique-sequence-numbers">Unique Sequence Numbers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fetch operations are used for things like giving unique sequence numbers to concurrent operations.</li>
<li>Using <code>fetch_add</code> on an atomic usize guarantees that every call to get a sequence number will get a distinct one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sequentially-consistent-ordering-1"><a class="header" href="#sequentially-consistent-ordering-1">Sequentially Consistent Ordering</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses sequentially consistent ordering and provides an example to demonstrate its difference from acquire-release ordering.</p>
<h3 id="example-with-atomic-bools-and-usize"><a class="header" href="#example-with-atomic-bools-and-usize">Example with Atomic Bools and Usize</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The example involves two threads storing values in atomic bools and one thread doing a fetch add on an atomic usize.</li>
<li>One thread stores true with ordering release while another stores y with no specified ordering.</li>
<li>A third thread does while not x load, acquires in a loop, checks if y again will acquire, then fetch adds one to z which is relaxed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-values-for-z"><a class="header" href="#possible-values-for-z">Possible Values for Z</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses possible values for z in a given code snippet.</p>
<h3 id="two-is-possible"><a class="header" href="#two-is-possible">Two is Possible</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Execution order: t x ty t1 t2</li>
<li>X is true and Y is true, so Z increments by 1 twice.</li>
<li>Therefore, Z equals 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-is-possible"><a class="header" href="#one-is-possible">One is Possible</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Execution order: tx t1 t2 ty t2</li>
<li>X is true but Y is false when T1 runs, so it does not increment Z.</li>
<li>When Ty runs, it sets Y to true.</li>
<li>When T2 runs, it sees that both X and Y are true and increments Z by 1.</li>
<li>Therefore, Z equals 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-may-not-be-possible"><a class="header" href="#zero-may-not-be-possible">Zero May Not Be Possible</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To achieve zero as the value of Z:
<ul>
<li>T1 must run after Tx.</li>
<li>T2 must run after Ty.</li>
<li>There are no other restrictions on execution order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mutex-panic-safety"><a class="header" href="#mutex-panic-safety">Mutex Panic Safety</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker answers a question about mutex panic safety.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mutex is panic safe but will not propagate panics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-11"><a class="header" href="#introduction-11">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses a pattern and execution order for threads.</p>
<h3 id="thread-execution-order"><a class="header" href="#thread-execution-order">Thread Execution Order</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that if t2 goes here, then ty must go before that and t1 will increment c because it runs after x and y have both been set to true.</li>
<li>If t2 goes after tx, ty still has to go before t2 is going to get to do anything useful. In either case, t1 and t2 will increment z because they’re both going to go after the things that set x and y.</li>
<li>If we place t2 at the end, ty could go here but if ty goes there then tx is already run so t2 will increment z. If ty went earlier, t2 would still increment c so there’s no place given this restriction where one of them won’t increment z. It seems impossible to have a thread schedule where z equals zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thread-schedules"><a class="header" href="#thread-schedules">Thread Schedules</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about thread schedules and how computers don’t have a single order that things run in.</p>
<h3 id="thread-schedules-1"><a class="header" href="#thread-schedules-1">Thread Schedules</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that thread schedules are just like the human desire to put things in order but in reality computers don’t have a single order that things run in.</li>
<li>We have multiple cores and those cores can show old values new values all we’re subject to are the exact rules of acquire and release semantics which is what we’ve given here.</li>
<li>There’s no requirement that we see anything that happened in another thread. When you spawn a thread these threads all happen after the main thread that spawned them so we must actually see this false it’s not like we could see a value written somewhere else independently but we must see this false or anything that happens later we can’t see if imagine that this thread did like x dot store true then the loads down here must see the store because it happened before them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="acquire-and-release-semantics"><a class="header" href="#acquire-and-release-semantics">Acquire and Release Semantics</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about acquire and release semantics.</p>
<h3 id="acquire-and-release-semantics-1"><a class="header" href="#acquire-and-release-semantics-1">Acquire and Release Semantics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that if you observe a value from acquire you will see all operations that happen before the corresponding release store while the corresponding release store is here in this thread there are no operations prior to the store but if there were we would be guaranteed to see them here because we’re synchronizing with tx but there are none.</li>
<li>This load synchronizes with this store so after this load we must see all memory operations that happened before this store. There’s no requirement that that’s any particular store of why if there had been a store of y in this thread if this did y dot store we must observe that y dot store because it happened strictly before this store which happened before this load because of acquire release so if there was a store here we must see it but there isn’t so we’re allowed to see any value for y.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-ordering-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-in-rust">Memory Ordering in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses memory ordering in Rust and how it affects concurrent operations.</p>
<h3 id="happens-before-relationship-2"><a class="header" href="#happens-before-relationship-2">Happens Before Relationship</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a thread runs, it synchronizes with other threads but there is no requirement that it sees any particular operation that happened to x because there’s no happens before relationship between the store here in tx and the load down here.</li>
<li>Acquire loads says that you’re not allowed to move any operation from below to above an acquire load so the compiler is not allowed to reorder these by the acquire semantics.</li>
<li>The load is allowed to see any previous value for x subject to happens before which does not include the operation of t y so therefore uh t2 must see this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concurrent-operations"><a class="header" href="#concurrent-operations">Concurrent Operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>T2 can see either of these and T1 can see either of these. If both threads run, then T1 runs, observes x being true but does not observe y being true even though T1 has run because there’s no happens before relationship there.</li>
<li>Imagine that it’s already in cache in the CPU or something; it just uses that value. It doesn’t bother to check again because it’s allowed not to. Therefore, this value is false even though Tx Ty ran; therefore, it does not increment one this one for some reason like it spins until y is true.</li>
<li>It observes that y is true great. It’s no requirement that it observes that x is true even though Tx has run so it does not increment c so therefore z is zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sequentially-consistent-operation"><a class="header" href="#sequentially-consistent-operation">Sequentially Consistent Operation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sexy as t (pronounced “sequentially consistent”) means acquire and release and acquire release with the additional guarantee that all threads see all sequentially consistent operations in the same order. If we make these all be sequentially consistent now, zero is no longer possible because if this thread observes that x observes x is true and then y is true, it establishes a happens before relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-ordering-and-sequential-consistency"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-and-sequential-consistency">Memory Ordering and Sequential Consistency</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses memory ordering and sequential consistency in concurrent programming.</p>
<h3 id="memory-ordering-1"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-1">Memory Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In concurrent programming, there must exist some ordering that’s consistent across all threads.</li>
<li>If some thread sees that x happened then y happened, then no thread is allowed to see x not happen even though y has happened.</li>
<li>If we end up with x is true and then y is true, then here y is true therefore x must be true. It’s not allowed to see x being false because that would be inconsistent with the memory ordering that these sequentially consistent operations saw.</li>
<li>The sequentially consistent ordering is only with relation to all other sequentially consistent operations.</li>
<li>Sequentially consistent only really interacts with other sequentially consistent acquire release does interact with sequentially consistent so sequentially consistent it is always stronger than acquire release.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-concurrent-code-1"><a class="header" href="#testing-concurrent-code-1">Testing Concurrent Code</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory ordering is real subtle and hard to get right.</li>
<li>Running your code lots of times in a loop or making your computer busy with other tasks can help test for errors but it’s not reliable since it might depend on the architecture, operating system scheduler, compiler optimizations, or how likely the error occurs.</li>
<li>Detecting bugs in concurrent code can be difficult since they may not cause a program crash or may go unnoticed for a long time.</li>

<ul>
<li>Google has built-in sanitizers in compilers like Clang, GCC, and MSVC.</li>
<li>The thread sanitizer is one of these sanitizers.</li>
<li>It detects unsynchronized operations on a single memory location by tracking every load and store operation in a program.</li>
<li>The algorithm for the thread sanitizer is specified in the documentation.</li>

<h3 id="loom"><a class="header" href="#loom">Loom</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Loom is a tool that implements the CDS Checker paper for Rust.</li>
<li>It takes a concurrent program, instruments it using loom synchronization and atomic types instead of standard library ones, and runs it multiple times to expose it to different possible executions.</li>
<li>Loom executes all possible thread interleavings and memory orderings to ensure that all legal executions of the program are explored.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about Loom, a tool used to test concurrent code. The speaker explains that Loom explores all possible legal executions of threads and implements a bunch of implementation things from the paper to reduce the number of possible executions.</p>
<h3 id="exploring-all-possible-legal-executions"><a class="header" href="#exploring-all-possible-legal-executions">Exploring All Possible Legal Executions</a></h3>

<li>Loom explores all possible legal executions of threads.</li>
<li>There might be an insane number of such possible executions.</li>
<li>Loom has a bunch of implementation things that are from the paper that looks at reducing those.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations-of-loom"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-loom">Limitations of Loom</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, there’s like a limit to how complex your test cases can be when you run them on the loop loom.</li>
<li>Even so, loom is the best tool I know of to try to make sure that your concurrent code is actually correct under only the assumptions that the memory model gives you rather than the assumptions that the current compiler or optimization or CPU might give you.</li>

<h3 id="limitations-of-zulu-1"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-zulu-1">Limitations of Zulu</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Zulu has some limitations, some of them are known problems, some of them are more fundamental problems with the approach or are just impossible to model.</li>
<li>Relaxed ordering is so relaxed that you can’t fully model all possible executions even with something like Loom.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker encourages people interested in concurrency to contribute to Loom.</li>
<li>The documentation for Loom has been recently updated and is recommended reading for anyone interested in using or contributing to the project.</li>
<li>Tokyo uses Loom and has caught several critical bugs, making it an important tool for detecting issues.</li>

<ul>
<li>Currently, Loom does not model sequentially consistent ordering correctly.</li>
<li>Implementing the additional guarantees required for sequentially consistent ordering is complex.</li>
<li>Downgrading every sequentially consistent order to acquire release means that while Loom won’t miss any bugs, it might give false positives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-contributions-can-help"><a class="header" href="#how-contributions-can-help">How Contributions Can Help</a></h3>
<ul>

<h3 id="atomic-module-in-sender-library"><a class="header" href="#atomic-module-in-sender-library">Atomic Module in Sender Library</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The atomic module in the sender library contains atomic types, constants, and three functions: spin loop hint, compiler fence, and fence.</li>
<li>Spin loop hint is deprecated and has been moved to the hint module. It is used in atomic contexts such as a spin lock.</li>
<li>Compiler fence ensures that the compiler won’t move a given load or store operation above or below a fence within that thread’s execution. It is mostly used for preventing a thread from racing with itself when using signal handlers.</li>
<li>Fence establishes a happens before relationship between two threads without talking about a particular memory location. It synchronizes with all other threads that are doing an offense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memory-ordering-2"><a class="header" href="#memory-ordering-2">Memory Ordering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Load acquire synchronizes or happens after store release of the same memory location.</li>
<li>Fence is basically an atomic operation that establishes a happens before relationship between two threads but without talking about a particular memory location.</li>

<h3 id="volatile-keyword-1"><a class="header" href="#volatile-keyword-1">Volatile Keyword</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no mention of volatile in the atomic module because it is just unrelated to atomics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-volatile"><a class="header" href="#understanding-volatile">Understanding Volatile</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what volatile is and its purpose.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-volatile"><a class="header" href="#what-is-volatile">What is Volatile?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Volatile is used when interacting with memory-mapped devices.</li>
<li>It ensures that operations cannot be reordered relative to other operations.</li>
<li>If you read twice from a given variable in memory map memory without using read volatile, the compiler would cache the first read into register and just read from the register for the second read. However, both reads need to go to memory to have a side effect on device map memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-pointer"><a class="header" href="#atomic-pointer">Atomic Pointer</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains atomic pointer and how it differs from other types.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-atomic-pointer"><a class="header" href="#what-is-atomic-pointer">What is Atomic Pointer?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Atomic pointer is an atomic usize where methods are specialized to the underlying type being a pointer.</li>
<li>It provides load, store, compare exchange and fetch update which is like having a nicer interface to doing a compare exchange loop.

<h2 id="introduction-to-standard-sync-mpsc-module"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-standard-sync-mpsc-module">Introduction to Standard Sync Mpsc Module</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the standard sync mpsc module and explains what a channel is.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-standard-sync-mpsc-module-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-standard-sync-mpsc-module-1">Introduction to Standard Sync Mpsc Module</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker introduces the standard sync mpsc module.</li>
<li>He explains that mpsc is a channel implementation that comes in the standard library.</li>
<li>A channel is just a way to send data from one place and receive it somewhere else.</li>
<li>The mpsc part of it means multi-producer single consumer. This means you can have many senders but only one receiver
so it’s a many-to-one channel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topics-covered-in-past-videos"><a class="header" href="#topics-covered-in-past-videos">Topics Covered in Past Videos</a></h2>

<h3 id="overview-of-standard-sync-mpsc-module-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-standard-sync-mpsc-module-1">Overview of Standard Sync Mpsc Module</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that when you create a channel using the standard sync mpsc module, you get a sender and receiver
handle.</li>
<li>You can move these handles independently to different threads to communicate over the channel.</li>
<li>The channel is unidirectional. Only senders can send and only receivers can receive.</li>
<li>You can clone the sender but not the receiver. This is why it’s called multi-producer single consumer.</li>

<h2 id="channel-implementation-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#channel-implementation-in-rust">Channel Implementation in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the implementation of channels in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="sender-and-receiver-types"><a class="header" href="#sender-and-receiver-types">Sender and Receiver Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A channel has two halves: a sender half and a receiver half.</li>
<li>The sender type is used to send data over the channel, while the receiver type is used to receive data from the
channel.</li>
<li>The sender and receiver types are different and can be distinguished from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sending-data-through-channels"><a class="header" href="#sending-data-through-channels">Sending Data through Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Data sent through a channel does not necessarily have to be sent between threads.</li>
<li>If a channel is used within the same thread, then the data is sent on that thread without needing to be sent across
threads.</li>
<li>There are no constraints on what types of data can be sent through a channel. Any type can be sent as long as it is
owned.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="size-constraints-for-types-sent-through-channels"><a class="header" href="#size-constraints-for-types-sent-through-channels">Size Constraints for Types Sent through Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Every type that is sent through a channel must implement the <code>Sized</code> trait unless you use <code>?Sized</code>.</li>
<li>If there’s no <code>?Sized</code>, then every type that is sent must be sized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ownership-of-data-in-channels"><a class="header" href="#ownership-of-data-in-channels">Ownership of Data in Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The channel object owns any data that is stored in it.</li>
<li>When something is sent over a channel, it remains owned by the channel until it’s received by another thread or
dropped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker demonstrates how to implement a simple version of channels in Rust using
concurrency primitives from its standard library.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details"><a class="header" href="#implementation-details">Implementation Details</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To implement channels in Rust, we need to create two structs: <code>Sender&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Receiver&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>We also need to create a function called <code>channel</code> which returns both halves of our newly created struct.</li>
<li>Our implementation will use other parts of Rust’s standard library such as sync module for concurrency primitives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance-considerations"><a class="header" href="#performance-considerations">Performance Considerations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The implementation demonstrated in this section is not the most performant.</li>

<h2 id="mutex-and-conditional-variables"><a class="header" href="#mutex-and-conditional-variables">Mutex and Conditional Variables</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how mutexes and conditional variables work in Rust’s concurrency
model.</p>
<h3 id="mutex"><a class="header" href="#mutex">Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A mutex is a way to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at any given time.</li>
<li>If two threads try to lock the same mutex, one will get to go while the other will block until the first thread
releases the guard.</li>
<li>This ensures that there’s only ever one thread modifying the shared resource at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arc-and-rc"><a class="header" href="#arc-and-rc">Arc and Rc</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Arc is an atomically reference counted type that allows for safe sharing of data across thread boundaries.</li>
<li>Rc is a reference counter type that does not allow for safe sharing of data across thread boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conditional-variables"><a class="header" href="#conditional-variables">Conditional Variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A conditional variable (convar) is a way to announce to a different thread that you’ve changed something it cares
about.</li>
<li>It allows a sender to wake up a receiver who was waiting because there was no data yet.</li>
<li>Together with mutexes, convars provide useful concurrency primitives for writing concurrent code safely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="channel-implementation-in-rust-1"><a class="header" href="#channel-implementation-in-rust-1">Channel Implementation in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker outlines how channels are implemented in Rust using mutexes and
conditional variables.</p>
<h3 id="inner-type"><a class="header" href="#inner-type">Inner Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The inner type holds the data that is shared between multiple handles or halves of the channel.</li>
<li>For now, it’s defined as an empty vector but will be modified later on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sender-and-receiver-types-1"><a class="header" href="#sender-and-receiver-types-1">Sender and Receiver Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Both sender and receiver types contain an inner type which is an arc-mutex-t holding shared state.</li>
<li>They both return their respective types containing this inner type when created.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-implementations"><a class="header" href="#alternative-implementations">Alternative Implementations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Linked lists could be used instead of vectors for storing data in channels.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="mutex-and-convar"><a class="header" href="#mutex-and-convar">Mutex and Convar</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the implementation of mutex and convar in Rust’s standard

</ul>
<h3 id="default-implementation-of-vec"><a class="header" href="#default-implementation-of-vec">Default Implementation of Vec</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The default implementation of vec can be used.</li>
<li>The question about why the receiver type needs to have an arc protected by a mutex if the channel may only have a
single consumer thread is answered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arc-mutex-vs-boolean-semaphore"><a class="header" href="#arc-mutex-vs-boolean-semaphore">Arc Mutex vs Boolean Semaphore</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A mutex is effectively a boolean semaphore, so there is no difference between them.</li>
<li>Using a boolean semaphore over the implementation in mutex would require spinning, which makes it less efficient than
using a mutex that integrates with parking mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mutex-vs-boolean-semaphore-continued"><a class="header" href="#mutex-vs-boolean-semaphore-continued">Mutex vs Boolean Semaphore Continued</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker continues discussing the differences between using a boolean semaphore
versus using a mutex for synchronization.</p>
<h3 id="problem-with-boolean-semaphore"><a class="header" href="#problem-with-boolean-semaphore">Problem with Boolean Semaphore</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If someone else has already taken the lock with a boolean semaphore, then you have to spin repeatedly checking it
until it becomes available again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-of-mutex"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-mutex">Advantages of Mutex</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>With a mutex, if someone else has taken it, then the operating system can put your thread to sleep and wake it back up
when the lock becomes available again.</li>
<li>This generally more efficient than spinning with a boolean semaphore but adds some latency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-arc-is-needed"><a class="header" href="#why-arc-is-needed">Why Arc Is Needed</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why an arc is needed for sender and receiver threads to
communicate.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-inner"><a class="header" href="#sharing-inner">Sharing Inner</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If there was no arc, then the sender and receiver would have two different instances of inner.</li>
<li>They need to share an inner because that’s where the sender puts data and where the receiver takes data out of.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-sender"><a class="header" href="#implementing-sender">Implementing Sender</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker starts implementing a send function for the sender thread.</p>
<h3 id="send-function"><a class="header" href="#send-function">Send Function</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The send function takes immute self and t that we’re going to send.</li>
<li>It returns nothing for now.</li>
<li>The lock is taken on self.inner.</li>
<li>Lock result is used in case another thread panicked while holding the lock.</li>
<li>Inner q is locked, and t is pushed onto it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-receiver"><a class="header" href="#implementing-receiver">Implementing Receiver</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker implements a receive method for the receiver thread.</p>
<h3 id="receive-method"><a class="header" href="#receive-method">Receive Method</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The receive method does not take a t but returns it instead.</li>
<li>The queue is locked with inner q.lock().</li>
<li>T is popped from the queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-vec-as-a-stack-and-ring-buffer"><a class="header" href="#using-vec-as-a-stack-and-ring-buffer">Using Vec as a Stack and Ring Buffer</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to use Vec as a stack and why it is better to use a ring
buffer instead.</p>
<h3 id="using-vec-as-a-stack"><a class="header" href="#using-vec-as-a-stack">Using Vec as a Stack</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A Vec can be used like a stack.</li>
<li>When removing an element from the front of the Vec, all other elements have to be shifted down to fill the hole left
by the removed element.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ring-buffer"><a class="header" href="#ring-buffer">Ring Buffer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A ring buffer is a type of collection that implements fixed memory.</li>
<li>It is similar to a vector but keeps track of start and end positions separately.</li>
<li>If you push an element to the end, it pushes it to the end.</li>
<li>If you pop from the front, it removes the element and moves a pointer to where data starts.</li>
<li>This allows for using it as a queue instead of just as a stack.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blocking-version-of-receive"><a class="header" href="#blocking-version-of-receive">Blocking Version of Receive</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, we learn about providing blocking version of receive in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="try-receive-method"><a class="header" href="#try-receive-method">Try Receive Method</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We can provide try_receive method that returns an option t if there’s nothing in there.</li>
<li>It just returns none if there’s nothing to receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blocking-version-of-receive-1"><a class="header" href="#blocking-version-of-receive-1">Blocking Version of Receive</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We want to provide blocking version of receive that waits for something in channel.</li>
<li>To do this, we need convar which needs to be outside mutex because when holding mutex and waking up another thread
causes deadlock.</li>
<li>The convar requires giving in mutex guard so that it does this step atomically.</li>
<li>We match on cue pop front; if sum t then return t else block with self inner available wait.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notification-and-waiting-receivers"><a class="header" href="#notification-and-waiting-receivers">Notification and Waiting Receivers</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how the sender needs to notify waiting receivers once it sends.
They explain that if a thread enters a loop and is sleeping when a send happens, the thread needs to wake up. The
speaker also introduces the use of <code>condvar</code> for notification.</p>
<h3 id="using-condvar-for-notification"><a class="header" href="#using-condvar-for-notification">Using Condvar for Notification</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that they will use <code>condvar</code> for notification.</li>
<li>They mention that <code>condvar</code> has a <code>notify_one()</code> and a <code>notify_all()</code> call.</li>
<li>The speaker drops the lock so that whoever they notify can wake up.</li>
<li>They notify one thread because they are the sender and know that this will be a receiver.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vector-double-ended-queue"><a class="header" href="#vector-double-ended-queue">Vector Double Ended Queue</a></h2>

<h3 id="understanding-vector-double-ended-queue"><a class="header" href="#understanding-vector-double-ended-queue">Understanding Vector Double Ended Queue</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker mentions that vector double ended queue is just like a vector with head and tail index.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-wait-vs-weight"><a class="header" href="#async-wait-vs-weight">Async Wait vs Weight</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker clarifies the difference between async wait and weight.</p>
<h3 id="difference-between-async-wait-and-weight"><a class="header" href="#difference-between-async-wait-and-weight">Difference Between Async Wait and Weight</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that weight requires you to give up the guard before going to sleep because otherwise whoever
would have woken you up can’t get the mutex.</li>
<li>They clarify that async wait is generally used when you are I/O bound, not CPU bound.</li>
<li>If you’re woken up without there being anything for you to do, you loop around, check the queue, realize it’s still
empty, then go back to sleep again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="convars-spurious-wake-ups"><a class="header" href="#convars-spurious-wake-ups">Convars Spurious Wake Ups</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how convars can have spurious wake ups.</p>
<h3 id="convars-spurious-wake-ups-1"><a class="header" href="#convars-spurious-wake-ups-1">Convars Spurious Wake Ups</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker mentions that one thing that can happen with convars is when you call weight, the operating system doesn’t
guarantee that you aren’t woken up without there being anything for you to do.</li>
<li>They explain that the loop checks the queue and goes back to sleep again if there’s nothing to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dropping-lock-before-notify"><a class="header" href="#dropping-lock-before-notify">Dropping Lock Before Notify</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker clarifies why they drop the lock before notify.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-lock-before-notify-1"><a class="header" href="#dropping-lock-before-notify-1">Dropping Lock Before Notify</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker clarifies that they drop the lock before notify so that when the other thread wakes up, it can immediately
take the lock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notify-one-vs-notify-all"><a class="header" href="#notify-one-vs-notify-all">Notify One vs Notify All</a></h2>

<h3 id="notify-one-vs-notify-all-1"><a class="header" href="#notify-one-vs-notify-all-1">Notify One vs Notify All</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that notify one means notifying one of the threads waiting on a specific convar.</li>
<li>They clarify that notify all notifies all waiting threads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-13"><a class="header" href="#introduction-13">Introduction</a></h2>

<h3 id="current-setup-for-senders"><a class="header" href="#current-setup-for-senders">Current Setup for Senders</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Senders cannot block in the current setup.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="making-sender-cloneable"><a class="header" href="#making-sender-cloneable">Making Sender Cloneable</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to make sender cloneable and why deriving clone is not
sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-clone-for-sender"><a class="header" href="#deriving-clone-for-sender">Deriving Clone for Sender</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Deriving clone at least at the moment actually desugars into impul t clone clone for sender t.</li>
<li>This implementation added the clone bound to t as well.</li>
<li>Inner might like if the structure you’re deriving clone on contains a t then t does need to be cloned in order for you
to clone the whole type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-clone-manually"><a class="header" href="#implementing-clone-manually">Implementing Clone Manually</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Arc implements clone regardless of whether the inner type is cloned that’s sort of what reference counting means.</li>
<li>We don’t actually need t to be cloned; we want this implementation.</li>
<li>The reason why we need to implement clone ourselves manually luckily it’s pretty simple though um it’s just inner is
self inner.clone().</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-our-clone-implementation"><a class="header" href="#using-our-clone-implementation">Using Our Clone Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, we discuss how to use our implemented clone method and why using dot operator can
cause issues.</p>
<h3 id="using-our-clone-method"><a class="header" href="#using-our-clone-method">Using Our Clone Method</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually what you want to do here is use our_clone() to say that I specifically want to clone the arc and not the thing
inside the arc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issues-with-dot-operator"><a class="header" href="#issues-with-dot-operator">Issues with Dot Operator</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagine that inner also implemented clone rust won’t know whether this call is supposed to clone the arc or thing
inside because arc dereferences to inner type and dot operator sort of recurses into the inner drafts.</li>
<li>Usually, it’s not what you want to write.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blocking-send-and-receive-methods"><a class="header" href="#blocking-send-and-receive-methods">Blocking Send and Receive Methods</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Send and receive should be blocking methods.</li>

<h2 id="testing-our-implementation"><a class="header" href="#testing-our-implementation">Testing Our Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, we discuss how to test our implementation using a ping pong test.</p>
<h3 id="ping-pong-test"><a class="header" href="#ping-pong-test">Ping Pong Test</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We create a tx and an rx.</li>

<li>We assert equals rx.receive(42).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arc-clone-and-channel-implementation"><a class="header" href="#arc-clone-and-channel-implementation">Arc Clone and Channel Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the implementation of arc clone and channels in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="coercing-to-trait-objects"><a class="header" href="#coercing-to-trait-objects">Coercing to Trait Objects</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>arc clone</code> cannot coerce to trait objects automatically.</li>
<li>It needs to be done manually by using <code>r clone as arctin trade</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming-channels"><a class="header" href="#naming-channels">Naming Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker prefers using <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code> for channels instead of the standard documentation’s use of <code>std</code>.</li>
<li>However, it ultimately comes down to personal preference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-channel-implementation"><a class="header" href="#problems-with-channel-implementation">Problems with Channel Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If there are no senders left, the receiver will block forever.</li>
<li>To solve this problem, we need a way to indicate that there are no more senders left and that the channel has been
closed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-shared-channels"><a class="header" href="#implementing-shared-channels">Implementing Shared Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We change the naming convention from <code>q</code> to <code>inner</code>.</li>
<li>A mutex is used to protect an inner t which holds both the queue and a count of senders.</li>
<li>Every time a sender is cloned, we increase the number of senders in that value.</li>
<li>When a sender goes away, we grab the lock and check if it was the last one. If so, we wake up any blocking receivers.</li>
<li>The receiver now returns an option t rather than just a t because it could be that the channel truly is empty forever.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-14"><a class="header" href="#introduction-14">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss potential optimizations for their implementation of a channel in
Rust.</p>
<h3 id="potential-optimization"><a class="header" href="#potential-optimization">Potential Optimization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers discuss the possibility of optimizing their implementation by using the reference count in the arc
instead of keeping track of senders.</li>
<li>They explain that with Arc, there is a strong count which tells how many instances of that arc there are. If there’s
only one, then that must be the receiver and therefore there are no senders.</li>
<li>They agree that it’s a good optimization and decide to get rid of the sender’s field.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complicated-case"><a class="header" href="#complicated-case">Complicated Case</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss a complicated case related to dropping a sender.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-sender"><a class="header" href="#dropping-sender">Dropping Sender</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers mention that if you drop a sender, you don’t know whether to notify because if the count is two, you
might be the last sender or you might be the second to last sender and the receiver has been dropped.</li>
<li>They decide to keep it as it was since it’s easier to read and there are plenty of optimizations they can make over
this implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-use-size"><a class="header" href="#atomic-use-size">Atomic Use Size</a></h2>

<li>The speakers suggest using an atomic use size and shared instead of creating inner.</li>
<li>However, they explain that at the moment you take a mutex, there isn’t really much value to it. It would mean you
don’t have to take lock in and drop and clone, but those should be relatively rare and the critical sections are short
enough that the lock should be fast anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notifying-all-for-drop"><a class="header" href="#notifying-all-for-drop">Notifying All for Drop</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss whether to notify all for drop.</p>
<h3 id="notifying-all-for-drop-1"><a class="header" href="#notifying-all-for-drop-1">Notifying All for Drop</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers discuss whether to notify all for drop.</li>
<li>They explain that when the last sender goes away, there will be at most one thread waiting which will be the receiver
if any.</li>
<li>They mention that there’s no correctness issue to waking up more threads, but it is a performance issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vector-default"><a class="header" href="#vector-default">Vector Default</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss vector default.</p>
<h3 id="vector-default-1"><a class="header" href="#vector-default-1">Vector Default</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers answer a question about the difference between vectec new and vector default. They explain that there is
no difference.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initializing-senders"><a class="header" href="#initializing-senders">Initializing Senders</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss initializing senders in their implementation of channel in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="initializing-senders-1"><a class="header" href="#initializing-senders-1">Initializing Senders</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers mention that they think the error was initializing senders to one in the constructor and then calling
clone on the sender they return.</li>
<li>They also answer a question about whether you can get false sharing in between vectec and sender count. They explain
that they’re under a mutex anyway so that shouldn’t matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging-closed-test"><a class="header" href="#debugging-closed-test">Debugging Closed Test</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers debug why their closed test did not work as expected.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-closed-test-1"><a class="header" href="#debugging-closed-test-1">Debugging Closed Test</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speakers mention that their closed test hangs forever on receive and they need to figure out why.</li>
<li>They decide to debug print the value of senders and see what comes out.</li>
<li>They realize that the sender is not being dropped and try assigning to underscore, but it doesn’t work as expected.</li>
<li>They finally realize that this implementation is pretty straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging-rust-programs-with-gdb"><a class="header" href="#debugging-rust-programs-with-gdb">Debugging Rust Programs with GDB</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses using GDB to debug Rust programs and how print debugging is
easier for small examples.</p>
<h3 id="using-print-debugging-instead-of-gdb"><a class="header" href="#using-print-debugging-instead-of-gdb">Using Print Debugging Instead of GDB</a></h3>

<h2 id="identifying-a-problem-with-the-implementation"><a class="header" href="#identifying-a-problem-with-the-implementation">Identifying a Problem with the Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker identifies a problem with the current implementation and discusses
whether send should always succeed or fail in some way.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-a-problem-with-closed-rx-channels"><a class="header" href="#identifying-a-problem-with-closed-rx-channels">Identifying a Problem with Closed RX Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The current implementation has a problem where it can go the other way around if there’s a closed RX channel.</li>
<li>It’s not clear whether send should always succeed or fail in some way when trying to send something on a closed
channel.</li>
<li>The decision is made to keep it as is but in real implementations, send might return an error if the channel is
closed.</li>
<li>If send fails, make sure to give back the value that was tried to be sent so that it can be used elsewhere or logged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-closed-flag-for-failed-sends"><a class="header" href="#implementing-closed-flag-for-failed-sends">Implementing Closed Flag for Failed Sends</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses implementing a closed flag for failed sends and how it would
work.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-closed-flag-for-failed-sends-1"><a class="header" href="#implementing-closed-flag-for-failed-sends-1">Implementing Closed Flag for Failed Sends</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want sending to be able to fail, you need to add a closed flag to the inner or just a boolean that the sender
sets.</li>
<li>When you send, if the flag is set, you return an error rather than pushing to the queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multi-producer-multiple-consumer"><a class="header" href="#multi-producer-multiple-consumer">Multi-Producer Multiple Consumer</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses whether it’s possible to resurrect a drop channel and how
multi-producer multiple consumer channels work.</p>
<h3 id="resurrecting-a-drop-channel-and-multi-producer-multiple-consumer-channels"><a class="header" href="#resurrecting-a-drop-channel-and-multi-producer-multiple-consumer-channels">Resurrecting a Drop Channel and Multi-Producer Multiple Consumer Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If the sender goes away, there’s no way to send anymore in this particular design.</li>
<li>In theory, we can add a method that lets you construct a sender from the receiver but most implementations are not
quite as symmetric as this one and you can’t easily create a center from a receiver.</li>
<li>Every operation takes the lock which is fine for low-performance channels but for high-performance channels with many
sends competing with each other, it might be better not to have them contend with one another.</li>
<li>Realistically, an implementation could allow sends to compete with each other and only synchronize between senders and
receivers instead of locking all of them.</li>
<li>The standard library channel has two different sender types: sender and sync sender. The difference between these is
that one is synchronous and the other is asynchronous.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous-channels"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-and-asynchronous-channels">Synchronous and Asynchronous Channels</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the difference between synchronous and asynchronous channels, and how they
handle back pressure.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-vs-asynchronous-channels"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-channels">Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The sender and receiver go in lockstep in a synchronous channel.</li>
<li>Sends can’t block in this implementation of asynchronous channels.</li>
<li>A synchronous channel has back pressure, meaning the sender will eventually start blocking if the receiver isn’t
keeping up.</li>
<li>The standard library has a sync channel function that takes a bound (channel capacity), whereas our channel method is
an infinite queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weak-counters-and-convars"><a class="header" href="#weak-counters-and-convars">Weak Counters and ConVars</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses weak counters, convars, and their use cases.</p>
<h3 id="using-weak-counters"><a class="header" href="#using-weak-counters">Using Weak Counters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Senders could use weak counters to determine if the receiver is still there before sending data.</li>
<li>Upgrading to a strong reference using weak counters adds overhead to each send operation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convars-without-mutexes"><a class="header" href="#convars-without-mutexes">ConVars Without Mutexes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>ConVars require mutex guards, so it’s not possible to have them without mutexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blocking-sends-on-vector-resizing"><a class="header" href="#blocking-sends-on-vector-resizing">Blocking Sends on Vector Resizing</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses vector resizing during sends and its impact on blocking.</p>
<h3 id="blocking-sends-during-vector-resizing"><a class="header" href="#blocking-sends-during-vector-resizing">Blocking Sends During Vector Resizing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pushing beyond the capacity of a vector requires allocating new memory for it, which takes time but doesn’t block
sends.</li>
<li>However, during this time, sends take longer than usual because they’re waiting for the vector resize to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resizing-insights"><a class="header" href="#resizing-insights">Resizing Insights</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about an optimization that can be made to the implementation of
channels.</p>
<h3 id="optimization-for-channels"><a class="header" href="#optimization-for-channels">Optimization for Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An optimization is made by encoding the assumption that there is only one receiver in the code to make it more
efficient.</li>
<li>The trick used is to steal all items that have been queued up rather than just stealing one since no one else will
take them.</li>
<li>When someone calls receive, we first check if we still have some leftover items from last time we took the lock. If
so, we return from there without taking the lock again.</li>
<li>If the queue is not empty and we get an item, then we check if there are more items in the queue and steal all of
them. We swap that vec deck with the one buffered inside ourselves and leave m empty self.buffer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-optimization"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-optimization">Benefits of Optimization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This optimization reduces contention because now, instead of taking a lock on every receive, it’s taken fewer times
making it faster to acquire.</li>
<li>It triggers twice as many resizes at predictable intervals but only uses twice as much memory which is also amortized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-source"><a class="header" href="#implementation-source">Implementation Source</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker got this optimization from other implementations since it’s a pretty common implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="branch-predictor-and-channel-implementations"><a class="header" href="#branch-predictor-and-channel-implementations">Branch Predictor and Channel Implementations</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the branch predictor and different flavors of channel
implementations.</p>
<h3 id="branch-predictor"><a class="header" href="#branch-predictor">Branch Predictor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The CPU has a built-in component that observes all conditional jumps.</li>
<li>It tries to remember whether it took the branch or not the last time.</li>
<li>Speculative execution comes into play where if it runs that code again, the branch predictor is going to say it’s
probably going to take the branch or it’s probably not going to take the branch.</li>
<li>Start running that code under the assumption that it will or won’t and then if it doesn’t end up doing that then go
back and unwind what you did and then do that stuff instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="channel-implementations"><a class="header" href="#channel-implementations">Channel Implementations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are multiple different kinds of flavors for channel implementations.</li>
<li>Usually, they take one of two approaches:
<ul>
<li>Different types for different implementations of channels</li>
<li>A single sender type with an enum-like implementation under the hood</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flavors have multiple implementations of your channel with different backing implementations chosen depending on how
the channel is used.</li>
<li>Common flavors include synchronous channels, asynchronous channels, rendezvous channels, and one-shot channels.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synchronous-channels"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-channels">Synchronous Channels</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a channel where send blocks.</li>
<li>Usually has limited capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="asynchronous-channels"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-channels">Asynchronous Channels</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a channel where send cannot block.</li>
<li>Usually unbounded so any number of sends can build up as much as stuff impossible in memory.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rendezvous-channels"><a class="header" href="#rendezvous-channels">Rendezvous Channels</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A synchronous channel with capacity equals zero.</li>
<li>Used for thread synchronization rather than sending data between threads.</li>
<li>Only allows sending if there’s currently a blocking receiver because you can’t store anything in the channel itself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-shot-channels"><a class="header" href="#one-shot-channels">One-Shot Channels</a></h4>
<p>Not discussed in detail.</p>
<h2 id="flavors-of-channels"><a class="header" href="#flavors-of-channels">Flavors of Channels</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the different flavors of channels in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="two-way-synchronization"><a class="header" href="#two-way-synchronization">Two-way Synchronization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Two-way synchronization occurs because the receiver cannot proceed until the sender arrives.</li>
<li>The channel version is still a two-way synchronization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-shot-channels-1"><a class="header" href="#one-shot-channels-1">One-shot Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One-shot channels are channels that you only send on once.</li>
<li>These can be any capacity, but usually, they are things like an application where you have a channel that you use to
tell all the threads that they should exit early.</li>
<li>You might have a channel that you only send on once and don’t send anything useful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bounded-and-unbounded-channels"><a class="header" href="#bounded-and-unbounded-channels">Bounded and Unbounded Channels</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Circular channels are often called bounded channels.</li>
<li>Asynchronous channels are often called unbounded channels.</li>
<li>In Rust, these flavors aren’t different types in the type system; they’re different implementations chosen between at
runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rendezvous-channel"><a class="header" href="#rendezvous-channel">Rendezvous Channel</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A rendezvous is not a mutex because it doesn’t guarantee mutual exclusion. It’s more like a convar in that you can
wake up another thread.</li>
<li>You can totally send data in a rendezvous channel right; it still has the t type, but if both sender and receiver
aren’t present, nothing happens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="different-implementations-of-channels"><a class="header" href="#different-implementations-of-channels">Different Implementations of Channels</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers different implementations of Rust’s synchronous channel and async-await futures.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-channel-with-mutex-plus-convar"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-channel-with-mutex-plus-convar">Synchronous Channel with Mutex Plus Convar</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For synchronous channels, what we implemented was a mutex plus convar as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="upgrading-channel-type-at-runtime"><a class="header" href="#upgrading-channel-type-at-runtime">Upgrading Channel Type at Runtime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially, assume that the channel is a one-shot channel.</li>
<li>The moment an additional send happens, upgrade it to be a different type of channel.</li>
<li>This means that the first send will be more efficient than later ones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-await-in-futures"><a class="header" href="#async-await-in-futures">Async Await in Futures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers async-await in Rust’s futures.</p>
<h3 id="async-await"><a class="header" href="#async-await">Async-Await</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The idea of async-await is that you can write code that looks like it’s synchronous, but it’s actually asynchronous.</li>
<li>You can use the <code>async</code> keyword to mark a function as being asynchronous.</li>
<li>You can then use the <code>await</code> keyword to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete.</li>
<li>In Rust, futures are used to represent asynchronous operations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-channels-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#implementing-channels-in-rust">Implementing Channels in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses different ways to implement channels in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="atomic-vectec-or-queue"><a class="header" href="#atomic-vectec-or-queue">Atomic Vectec or Queue</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use an atomic vectec or queue to update head and tail pointers atomically.</li>
<li>No need to take a mutex in order to send.</li>
<li>Update head and tail pointers atomically to ensure no thread ever tries to touch data that another thread is currently
touching.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="signaling-mechanism"><a class="header" href="#signaling-mechanism">Signaling Mechanism</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use park and notify primitives from the standard library or parking lot for wake-ups.</li>
<li>Need some signaling mechanism where if the sender is asleep because it’s blocking, the receiver needs to wake it up if
it receives something because now there’s capacity available.</li>
<li>Similarly, if the receiver is blocking because the channel is empty and a sender comes along and sends something, it
needs to make sure to wake up the receiver.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linked-list-implementation"><a class="header" href="#linked-list-implementation">Linked List Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a linked list implementation instead of a vectec when resizing becomes problematic.</li>
<li>When a sender comes along, append or push to the front of the linked list.</li>
<li>The receiver steals all items by setting head to null or none and walking backwards through the doubly linked list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="atomic-linked-list"><a class="header" href="#atomic-linked-list">Atomic Linked List</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An atomic linked list is often referred to as an atomic queue.</li>
<li>Mix atomic head and tail with an atomic linked list so that only occasionally do you need to actually append new
items.</li>
<li>This avoids problematic operations when two senders want to send at the same time with a linked list.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optimizing-channel-implementations"><a class="header" href="#optimizing-channel-implementations">Optimizing Channel Implementations</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to optimize channel implementations by using a wake-up
primitive instead of a linked list for rendezvous channels.</p>
<h3 id="using-wake-up-primitive-instead-of-linked-list"><a class="header" href="#using-wake-up-primitive-instead-of-linked-list">Using Wake-Up Primitive Instead of Linked List</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A block atomic linked list is more efficient in practice.</li>
<li>A single place in memory can store the item for handoff.</li>
<li>You don’t need a linked list at all; you only need a wake-up primitive.</li>
<li>An atomic place in memory that is either none or some can be used to swap elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specialized-implementations"><a class="header" href="#specialized-implementations">Specialized Implementations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>More specialized implementations can be written that are faster for specific use cases.</li>
<li>Async await channels have different implementations than blocking thread world channels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-overhead-vs-memory-allocator-performance"><a class="header" href="#memory-overhead-vs-memory-allocator-performance">Memory Overhead vs. Memory Allocator Performance</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the trade-off between memory overhead and memory allocator
performance when using linked lists in channel implementations.</p>
<h3 id="linked-lists-and-allocationdeallocation"><a class="header" href="#linked-lists-and-allocationdeallocation">Linked Lists and Allocation/Deallocation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>With linked lists, an allocation/deallocation occurs on each push/pop operation.</li>
<li>The memory allocation system is not always the bottleneck, especially with thread-local allocation like jmallock.</li>
<li>Measuring memory overhead versus memory allocator performance is important.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reusing-pool-of-nodes"><a class="header" href="#reusing-pool-of-nodes">Reusing Pool of Nodes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a pool of nodes around can help reduce allocations/deallocations.</li>
<li>Managing the pool atomically requires synchronization primitives and may not be better than using a memory allocator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-channels-for-async-await"><a class="header" href="#implementing-channels-for-async-await">Implementing Channels for Async Await</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges of implementing channels for both async await
and blocking thread worlds.</p>
<h3 id="differences-in-primitives"><a class="header" href="#differences-in-primitives">Differences in Primitives</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to write a channel implementation that works for both async await and blocking thread worlds.</li>
<li>Yielding to the parent future is necessary in async await when the channel is full.</li>
<li>Notification primitives are similar but not quite the same.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="internal-implementation"><a class="header" href="#internal-implementation">Internal Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing an implementation that knows whether it’s being used in async context or blocking context without exposing it
to the user can be challenging.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="channel-implementations-1"><a class="header" href="#channel-implementations-1">Channel Implementations</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses channel implementations and their underlying data structures.
They also talk about memory allocation and the use of channels in their thesis.</p>
<h3 id="blocking-vs-async-worlds"><a class="header" href="#blocking-vs-async-worlds">Blocking vs Async Worlds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>At runtime, channel implementations diverge into different ways of managing the underlying data store depending on
whether you’re in the blocking world or not.</li>
<li>In practice, the data structure used is fairly similar regardless of whether you’re using a vector or an atomic linked
list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memory-allocation"><a class="header" href="#memory-allocation">Memory Allocation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Allocators are good at taking advantage of repeated patterns, so it’s hard to write good performant garbage collection
and memory allocator has had a lot of practice with it.</li>
<li>It’s not clear if you could beat the allocator because we always need allocations of the same size.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-of-channels-in-thesis"><a class="header" href="#use-of-channels-in-thesis">Use of Channels in Thesis</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker uses Tokyo channels because they needed one with async. They don’t have a particularly strong feeling
about it.</li>
<li>The decision wasn’t that important since Noria is not really channel-bound.</li>
<li>The standard library channel didn’t support async await when they started adding them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-implementation-examples"><a class="header" href="#real-implementation-examples">Real Implementation Examples</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker recommends looking at real implementation examples for channels and
provides some pointers on where to look next.</p>
<h3 id="standard-library-implementation"><a class="header" href="#standard-library-implementation">Standard Library Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The mpsc module in Rust’s standard library has really good documentation on what’s going on under the hood and some
optimizations that they do like internal atomic counters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="crossbeam-channel-implementation"><a class="header" href="#crossbeam-channel-implementation">Crossbeam Channel Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Crossbeam has a cross beam channel subdirectory that holds all different flavor implementations such as array for
synchronous channels, headtail business for multi-producer single consumer, and atomic block linked list for
multi-producer multi-consumer.</li>
<li>Flume is a different implementation of channels that popped up fairly recently. It has a very different implementation
to what crossbeam does.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benchmarking-channel-implementations"><a class="header" href="#benchmarking-channel-implementations">Benchmarking Channel Implementations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarking channel implementations is hard. Burnt Sushi did a bunch of benchmarking of channels looking at go
channels, the standard library channels, flume, crossbeam channel, and chan crate.</li>
<li>When benchmarking channels, you want to try to benchmark all the different flavors because they represent real use
cases. You want your benchmark to test cases where you send large or small things with many or few senders.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benchmarking-possible-configurations"><a class="header" href="#benchmarking-possible-configurations">Benchmarking Possible Configurations</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker suggests creating a grid of all possible configurations and benchmarking each one
separately.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-grid-of-configurations"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-grid-of-configurations">Creating a Grid of Configurations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker suggests creating a grid of all possible configurations.</li>
<li>Rendezvous channels are like the default go channels with zero capacity.</li>
<li>A bump allocator would be really good since you would likely allocate memory atomically quite possibly and also
because it you don’t need to drop anything in that case because the memory has already been handed off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="async-await-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#async-await-ecosystem">Async Await Ecosystem</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker explains how async is supported without tying it to a specific executor like Tokyo.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-async-without-tying-it-to-a-specific-executor"><a class="header" href="#supporting-async-without-tying-it-to-a-specific-executor">Supporting Async Without Tying It To A Specific Executor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The primary reason for the lack of harmony in the async await ecosystem is around the i/o traits.</li>
<li>Implementing a channel does not require either asynchronous or spawn features. All that’s needed is the primitive
provided by the standard library, which is the waker trait, and the ability to yield or go to sleep and wake something
up or notify something. These are from the standard task module in the standard library, so they can be used
independently of what executor is being used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sleeping-center-thread"><a class="header" href="#sleeping-center-thread">Sleeping Center Thread</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker explains how to wake up a sleeping center thread if its receiver is dropped.</p>
<h3 id="waking-up-a-sleeping-center-thread"><a class="header" href="#waking-up-a-sleeping-center-thread">Waking Up A Sleeping Center Thread</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a sleeping center thread and you’d like to wake it if the receiver is dropped, implement drop for your
receiver where it will do a notify all to wake up all sleeping centers which could then do whatever freeing up of
resources it needs to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this video, we will learn about declarative macros and how they work in Rust. We will focus on
macro rules and implement the <code>vec!</code> macro from the standard library.</p>
<h3 id="macro-rules"><a class="header" href="#macro-rules">Macro Rules</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:00:22s"></a> Declarative macros are defined using macro rules.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:02:39s"></a> Macro rules consist of a name followed by an exclamation point, followed by a bracket containing
patterns that serve as arguments to the macro.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:03:20s"></a> The patterns for macros are looser than those for functions and can include syntax types such as
identifiers, expressions, items, blocks, type names or module paths.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-the-vec-macro"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-vec-macro">Implementing the <code>vec!</code> Macro</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:01:49s"></a> The <code>vec!</code> macro is used to declare a vector using either a vector literal syntax or by specifying an
element that is cloneable along with its count.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:04:05s"></a> To implement the <code>vec!</code> macro, we need to understand some handy patterns explained in “The Little Book
of Rust Macros”.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:04:29s"></a> Section four of “The Little Book of Rust Macros” provides useful patterns for implementing macros.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this video provides an introduction to declarative macros and demonstrates how to implement them using macro
rules. We also learned about the <code>vec!</code> macro from the standard library and how it can be implemented using these
concepts.</p>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about trailing commas and how to allow them in Rust format.</p>
<h3 id="allowing-trailing-commas"><a class="header" href="#allowing-trailing-commas">Allowing Trailing Commas</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When things wrap, you often want to have a trailing comma.</li>
<li>The current pattern doesn’t allow that because it expects a comma-separated list of things with an expression
following each comma.</li>
<li>To allow trailing commas, add a pattern that allows any number of commas after the normal pattern.</li>

<h3 id="testing-invalid-expressions"><a class="header" href="#testing-invalid-expressions">Testing Invalid Expressions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust assigns any error produced by a macro to the corresponding place in the macro input.</li>
<li>A test that includes an invalid expression will not compile and will produce an error message pointing to the location
of the error.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-optimization"><a class="header" href="#compiler-optimization">Compiler Optimization</a></h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="doc-tests"><a class="header" href="#doc-tests">Doc Tests</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust does not have a way to say that a unit test should not compile, but there is a crate called “compile fail” that
allows you to write tests that are not supposed to compile.</li>
<li>Doc tests can be used as a cheap way to get compiled fail tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="veck-macro-comparison"><a class="header" href="#veck-macro-comparison">Veck Macro Comparison</a></h3>

<h2 id="more-efficient-implementation"><a class="header" href="#more-efficient-implementation">More Efficient Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to create a more efficient implementation by reducing
reallocations and pointer increments.</p>
<h3 id="reducing-reallocations"><a class="header" href="#reducing-reallocations">Reducing Reallocations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Creating an empty vector and then calling push a thousand twenty-four times will require many reallocations.</li>
<li>Using capacity count can help allocate for a specific number of elements.</li>
<li>Standard iterator repeat element take count can be used instead of push to avoid bounds checking for every iteration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pointer-increments"><a class="header" href="#pointer-increments">Pointer Increments</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Push still requires pointer increments which can add up if creating a vector with many elements in a busy loop.</li>
<li>Standard iterator repeat plus take does not implement exact size and can be improved.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="veck-macro"><a class="header" href="#veck-macro">Veck Macro</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the Veck macro and its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="veck-macro-implementation"><a class="header" href="#veck-macro-implementation">Veck Macro Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Veck macro is a more sophisticated operation that requires special treatment.</li>
<li>If an iterator is produced, it must be implemented as an exact size iterator.</li>
<li>The macro does not have any trait bounds, so if something that isn’t clone is used, the compiler will generate an
error.</li>
<li>The error output generated by the macro expansion points to where the type that didn’t implement clone came from.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Veck macro does purely power of two expansion.</li>
<li>It will do ten allocations before it even gets to 1024, making it inefficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hygienic-macros-1"><a class="header" href="#hygienic-macros-1">Hygienic Macros</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses hygienic macros and how they can be affected by caller-defined modules.</p>
<h3 id="caller-defined-modules"><a class="header" href="#caller-defined-modules">Caller-defined Modules</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When defining macros, you have to be careful because the caller might have modules that override you.</li>
<li>Macros aren’t entirely hygienic because they can’t express certain things like crate or colon colon which are root
level paths.</li>
<li>If someone renames the crate STD then they deserve the problems they get.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to define a macro to avoid repeating elements in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-macro-to-define-an-expression"><a class="header" href="#using-a-macro-to-define-an-expression">Using a Macro to Define an Expression</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The problem with repeating an element multiple times is that it can cause issues.</li>
<li>Rust figures out how many times to repeat a block by looking at which variables are used inside of it.</li>
<li>If we don’t use any variables, Rust doesn’t know how many times to repeat the block.</li>
<li>We can define a substitute variant that takes an expression and returns unit instead of using repetition.</li>
<li>By expanding the macro with substitution, Rust knows how many times to repeat the block because we’re using element in
there.</li>

<h3 id="counting-trick-for-arrays"><a class="header" href="#counting-trick-for-arrays">Counting Trick for Arrays</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The type does not give the length of the array, so we need to use a counting trick.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to count tokens in Rust macros and the tricks involved in
doing so.</p>
<h3 id="tricks-for-counting-tokens"><a class="header" href="#tricks-for-counting-tokens">Tricks for Counting Tokens</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can use size of to count tokens, but it ends up allocating.</li>
<li>There are other tricks like zero plus multiple replacements with one that can be used to count tokens. However, if you
do enough of these, you will crash the compiler.</li>
<li>You can also count the number of tokens by counting sub-patterns and batching them. This has been tested up to ten
thousand tokens but cannot be used to produce a constant expression.</li>
<li>There are versions that can produce a constant expression like extracting the enum counter to get the number of items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-procedural-macros"><a class="header" href="#using-procedural-macros">Using Procedural Macros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When counting tokens gets too complicated, you can write it as a procedural macro instead.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="predefined-count-macro"><a class="header" href="#predefined-count-macro">Predefined Count Macro</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently, there is no predefined count macro because it’s hard to know what exactly needs to be counted (e.g., number

<h2 id="topics-covered"><a class="header" href="#topics-covered">Topics Covered</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the various topics that will be discussed in the video.</p>
<h3 id="traits-and-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#traits-and-dispatch">Traits and Dispatch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The video covers traits and dynamic and static dispatch.</li>
<li>Dynamic dispatch is when you have a pointer to an object on the heap.</li>
<li>Static dispatch is when you have a concrete type.</li>
<li>Traits are used to define shared behavior between types.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="size-trait"><a class="header" href="#size-trait">Size Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m10s"></a> The size trait is used to determine the size of a type at compile time.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m20s"></a> It can be used for optimization purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wide-or-fat-pointers"><a class="header" href="#wide-or-fat-pointers">Wide or Fat Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m25s"></a> Wide or fat pointers are pointers that contain additional information about their referent.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m35s"></a> They are useful for dynamically sized types like slices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-tables-coherence"><a class="header" href="#v-tables-coherence">V Tables Coherence</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m45s"></a> V tables coherence refers to how Rust ensures that all implementations of a trait are consistent with each
other.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=2m0s"></a> It ensures that there is only one implementation of a trait for any given type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monomorphization-1"><a class="header" href="#monomorphization-1">Monomorphization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=2m8s"></a> Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types
that are used when compiled.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=2m23s"></a> It enables more efficient code generation by allowing the compiler to generate specialized code for each
concrete type.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-book"><a class="header" href="#rust-book">Rust Book</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers a chapter in the Rust book on generic types, traits, and lifetimes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m23s"></a> The Rust book has a chapter on generic types and traits.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1m44s"></a> The chapter discusses the performance of code using generics and introduces the concept of
monomorphization.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=2m23s"></a> Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete
types that are used when compiled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monomorphization-and-generics-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#monomorphization-and-generics-in-rust">Monomorphization and Generics in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how generics work in Rust and the process of monomorphization.</p>
<h3 id="generics-in-rust-1"><a class="header" href="#generics-in-rust-1">Generics in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Generics in Rust are turned by the compiler into multiple non-generic implementations through a process called
monomorphization.</li>
<li>Monomorphization generates a full copy of the entire struct and all its methods for each type that it is used by.</li>
<li>The generation of copies happens on demand determined at compile time when code needs a function for a given type.</li>
<li>Rust generates distinct copies of functions for each type, which makes it hard to ship people a binary that they can
use as a library.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-monomorphization"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-monomorphization">Benefits of Monomorphization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Monomorphization produces potentially much more efficient code because the compiler gets to see the concrete
written-out code for particular types that are used, which lets it optimize better.</li>
<li>For hashmap, it only generates methods you actually end up calling, so it amortizes the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="downsides-of-monomorphization"><a class="header" href="#downsides-of-monomorphization">Downsides of Monomorphization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One downside is that your binary ends up being larger because you need to generate a copy of the type or function for
every type that it’s used with.</li>
<li>Another downside is that rather than having one function called sterling, you end up with more code in the final
binary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-binary-size-and-monomorphization"><a class="header" href="#rust-binary-size-and-monomorphization"><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:09s">#</a> Rust Binary Size and Monomorphization</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the reasons why Rust binaries are larger than C ones, and how monomorphization
works.</p>
<h3 id="monomorphization-and-binary-size"><a class="header" href="#monomorphization-and-binary-size">Monomorphization and Binary Size</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:09s"></a> The compiler generates copies of functions during monomorphization, but this is usually not too costly
unless instantiated with a large number of types.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:13:23s"></a> Monomorphization allows for inlining and optimizing based on the specific type used, which can result
in larger binary sizes due to more static compilation.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:14:43s"></a> The size of the standard library used also affects binary size, especially if using many generics from
it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debug-symbols-and-stripping-binaries"><a class="header" href="#debug-symbols-and-stripping-binaries">Debug Symbols and Stripping Binaries</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:32s"></a> Rust binaries statically compile more stuff, including debug symbols that can make the binary larger.
Stripping the binary can help reduce its size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generics-in-dynamic-libraries"><a class="header" href="#generics-in-dynamic-libraries"><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:15:00s">#</a> Generics in Dynamic Libraries</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses how dynamic libraries handle generics in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-libraries-and-generics"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-libraries-and-generics">Dynamic Libraries and Generics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:15:34s"></a> Dynamic libraries do not handle generics in Rust. This makes it challenging to distribute Rust
libraries in binary form or use them for dynamically linked libraries.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:16:14s"></a> Swift has been trying to stabilize something similar to dynamic linking for Rust, but it is still
unclear how it will work.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:16:49s"></a> Defining a trait involves creating a method that can be implemented for different types.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:17:17s"></a> Implementing the trait for a specific type involves defining the method for that type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dispatching-methods"><a class="header" href="#dispatching-methods">Dispatching Methods</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:17:26s"></a> When generating code for a trait, the compiler determines the type and looks up which methods are
available.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:18:00s"></a> The dispatch process involves selecting the appropriate method based on the type used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="static-dispatch-vs-dynamic-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#static-dispatch-vs-dynamic-dispatch">Static Dispatch vs Dynamic Dispatch</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the difference between static dispatch and dynamic dispatch.</p>
<h3 id="static-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#static-dispatch">Static Dispatch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When the compiler generates machine code, it knows the type of h and can call the method directly. This is known as
static dispatch.</li>
<li>The method is trivial to figure out where it lives because the compiler knows what the actual type is.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we don’t want to generate multiple copies, we use dynamically sized types or generics.</li>
<li>We can treat things that are different concrete types as the same type using trait objects.</li>
<li>Dynamic dispatch allows us to treat different concrete types as if they were the same type.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses trait objects and the sized trait. They explain how trait
objects work and why we need to use them. They also discuss the sized trait and its importance in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="trait-objects-1"><a class="header" href="#trait-objects-1">Trait Objects</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bar is generic over one type which has to be either a stir reference or a string.</li>
<li>When taking a slice or an iterator, there is nowhere to put h2 as there is only one iterator that only has items of
one type.</li>
<li>Type erasure is used to take a collection of things where we only care about implementing a specific trait.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-sized-trait"><a class="header" href="#the-sized-trait">The Sized Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The size trait has no methods; it’s just a marker trait that requires types with constant sizes known at compile time.</li>
<li>Every trait bound requires that the type is sized implicitly.</li>
<li>The compiler needs to know how large an argument is so it can allocate space on the stack for it when calling
functions.</li>
<li>The size of an argument can be determined by knowing its concrete implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dynamic-dispatch-and-object-safety"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-dispatch-and-object-safety">Dynamic Dispatch and Object Safety</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses dynamic dispatch and object safety in Rust. They explain what
dynamic dispatch means, why it’s important, and how it works in Rust. They also discuss object safety and what makes a
trait object safe or unsafe.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch-1"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-dispatch-1">Dynamic Dispatch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic dispatch allows us to call methods on objects whose concrete types are unknown at compile time.</li>
<li>Virtual method tables (VMTs), also known as vtables, are used to implement dynamic dispatch in Rust.</li>
<li>VMTs contain pointers to the actual functions that will be called at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="object-safety"><a class="header" href="#object-safety">Object Safety</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A trait is object-safe if it can be safely used as a trait object.</li>
<li>A trait is not object-safe if it has associated types or self-referential methods.</li>
<li>The compiler will generate an error if we try to use a non-object-safe trait as a trait object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-traits-for-trait-objects"><a class="header" href="#implementing-traits-for-trait-objects">Implementing Traits for Trait Objects</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to implement traits for trait objects. They explain what it
means to implement a trait for a type and how this differs from implementing a trait for a trait object. They also
discuss how to use the <code>dyn</code> keyword when working with trait objects.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-traits"><a class="header" href="#implementing-traits">Implementing Traits</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To implement a trait for a type, we simply define the methods of the trait on that type.</li>
<li>To implement a trait for a trait object, we need to use dynamic dispatch and vtables.</li>
<li>We can use the <code>dyn</code> keyword when working with trait objects to indicate that we want dynamic dispatch.</li>

<h2 id="downcasting-trait-objects"><a class="header" href="#downcasting-trait-objects">Downcasting Trait Objects</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses downcasting and how it works with Rust’s type system. They
explain what downcasting means and why it’s useful. They also discuss how to downcast using Rust’s built-in <code>as</code>
operator.</p>
<h3 id="downcasting"><a class="header" href="#downcasting">Downcasting</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Downcasting allows us to convert from one type of pointer (e.g., <code>&amp;T</code>) to another (e.g., <code>&amp;U</code>) when <code>T</code> is a supertype
of <code>U</code>.</li>
<li>Downcasting can be useful when working with trait objects, as it allows us to access methods that are specific to the
concrete type of the object.</li>
<li>We can use Rust’s built-in <code>as</code> operator to downcast trait objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-21"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-21">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes their discussion on trait objects in Rust. They summarize the
key points covered in the video and provide some final thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trait objects allow us to work with collections of objects that implement a specific trait without knowing their
concrete types at compile time.</li>
<li>The sized trait is important because it allows the compiler to determine how much space an argument takes up on the
stack.</li>
<li>Dynamic dispatch and vtables are used to implement trait objects and allow us to call methods on unknown types at

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces a problem with Rust’s type system and explains why it is
important to understand.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-din-high"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-with-din-high">The Problem with Din High</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust allows for traits to be used as types.</li>
<li>However, when using a trait as a type, there can be issues with size.</li>
<li>This is because different types that implement the same trait may have different sizes.</li>
<li>This can cause problems when trying to use these types in arrays or slices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-the-issue"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-issue">Understanding the Issue</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker goes into more detail about why the issue occurs and how it affects code.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-different-sizes"><a class="header" href="#types-of-different-sizes">Types of Different Sizes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Strings and stirs are examples of types that have different sizes but implement the same trait.</li>
<li>A slice is just a contiguous piece of memory where each chunk is the same size.</li>
<li>If we don’t know the size of each element in a slice, we can’t guarantee that they are all the same size.</li>
<li>This makes it impossible to generate code for functions that require knowing how much space to allocate for variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-sized-trait"><a class="header" href="#implementing-sized-trait">Implementing Sized Trait</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how Rust implements sizing for types and what exceptions there
may be.</p>
<h3 id="auto-implementation-of-sized-trait"><a class="header" href="#auto-implementation-of-sized-trait">Auto Implementation of Sized Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Sized</code> trait is auto-implemented for any type that can implement it.</li>
<li>For example, if you create a struct with no fields or add a string field to it, then that struct will be sized
automatically.</li>
<li>You never need to implement <code>Sized</code> yourself; it is only ever used as an auto-trait.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-that-are-not-sized"><a class="header" href="#types-that-are-not-sized">Types That Are Not Sized</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses some examples of traits that are not sized and what issues they
can cause.</p>
<h3 id="traits-that-are-not-sized"><a class="header" href="#traits-that-are-not-sized">Traits That Are Not Sized</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traits like <code>High</code> are not sized because different types that implement the trait may have different sizes.</li>
<li>This makes it impossible to generate code for functions that require knowing how much space to allocate for variables.</li>
<li>The compiler needs to know the size of a type in order to generate efficient code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indirection-through-sized-types"><a class="header" href="#indirection-through-sized-types">Indirection through Sized Types</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to make a type that is not sized into a type that is always
sized by indirecting it through some type that is itself sized.</p>
<h3 id="making-an-unsized-type-sized"><a class="header" href="#making-an-unsized-type-sized">Making an Unsized Type Sized</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An example of an unsized type is <code>dyn Trait</code> or <code>str</code>.</li>
<li>To make an unsized type like <code>dyn Trait</code> or <code>str</code> into a sized type, we need to indirect it through some other type
that is itself sized.</li>
<li>Examples of such types include references (<code>&amp;T</code>) and boxes (<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>By indirection through these types, the size of the argument becomes known and relevant code can be generated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-box-to-make-an-unsized-type-sized"><a class="header" href="#using-box-to-make-an-unsized-type-sized">Using Box to Make an Unsized Type Sized</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to use <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> to make an unsized type like <code>str</code> into a
sized type.</p>
<h3 id="using-box"><a class="header" href="#using-box">Using Box<T></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A box has a known size because it’s just a pointer.</li>
<li>When you create a box initially, you allocate space for whatever you’re going to put inside of it.</li>
<li>The box is still of a known size even if what it points to might have an arbitrary size.</li>
<li>You can create a box of something that itself is not sized by opting out of the auto-bound that gets added saying for
box the T does not have to be sized.</li>
<li>Once you do this, you can pass the boxed value as an argument without getting monomorphization errors.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:45:59s"></a> A trait object is an object that only has the property of representing a trait.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:46:35s"></a> When you turn an object into a trait object, you erase all knowledge about what type it used to be.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:47:20s"></a> You can technically go back through unsafe transmutes and any traits, but in general, you should ignore
that.</li>

<p>Section Overview: This section discusses dynamically sized types, which are only known at runtime, and v-tables, which
are little data structures that have pointers to each of the methods for a trait for a type.</p>
<h3 id="dynamically-sized-types"><a class="header" href="#dynamically-sized-types">Dynamically Sized Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Slices and trait objects are two examples of dynamically sized types.</li>
<li>At compile time, we don’t know what type this is going to be. It’s only at runtime that we’ll know.</li>
<li>The reason why this is determined at runtime is because some input can’t be predicted at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-tables"><a class="header" href="#v-tables">V-Tables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A v-table or virtual dispatch table is a little data structure that has pointers to each of the methods for the trait
for the type.</li>
<li>When you have a trait object like <code>dyn Hi</code>, what actually gets stored in the reference is one pointer to the actual
concrete implementing type and two a pointer to a v-table for the referenced trait.</li>
<li>A different v-table ends up being constructed for each concrete type turned into a trait object.</li>
<li>The second pointer in there will always be known statically because it’s determined by the original construction of
the trait object.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:59:03s"></a> Trait objects are pointers to string references, not pointers to actual strings.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:59:23s"></a> The vtable struct for a trait object contains a member for each method of the corresponding trait that
this is a trait object for.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:59:48s"></a> The value in the vtable struct is the pointer to the implementation of that method for the concrete

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1:00:12s"></a> The vtable is generally statically constructed for the type and does not get constructed dynamically.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1:00:32s"></a> Identical vtables are not detected, and they are guaranteed to not be duplicates even if they contain
the same code.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=1:01:00s"></a> If you implement a trait for two different types, then the implementations are still distinct locations

<ul>
<li>When combining traits, adding a trait to a larger v table tells the developer that they can do something else instead.</li>
<li>Developers can generate their own trait here.</li>
<li>Only auto traits like Send and Sync are fine for marker traits because they don’t have any methods.</li>

<h3 id="object-safety-1"><a class="header" href="#object-safety-1">Object Safety</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If an associated type is added to a trait, it cannot be turned into a trait object directly. Instead, developers must
specify the associated type when taking in the trait.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <code>weird</code> function cannot be called through a trait object because it requires a valid instance of the type that
implements the trait.</li>
<li>If there were multiple implementations of <code>weird</code>, it would not be clear which one to call through a trait object.</li>
<li>To make sure that the trait remains object safe, you can opt out of including certain functions in the vtable by
requiring that <code>self</code> is sized. This means that these functions cannot be called through a trait object.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disallowing-trait-objects"><a class="header" href="#disallowing-trait-objects">Disallowing Trait Objects</a></h3>
<ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses whether it is possible to implement a trait for concrete
dynamically sized types (DSTs), such as <code>Box&lt;dyn AsRef&lt;str&gt;&gt;</code>. They also explain why there are restrictions on
implementing traits for DSTs.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-traits-for-concrete-dsts-1"><a class="header" href="#implementing-traits-for-concrete-dsts-1">Implementing Traits for Concrete DSTs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to implement a trait for concrete DSTs if the <code>where Self: Sized</code> constraint is not present.</li>
<li>The reason this should be possible is because when you wrap a type behind a pointer, it now has a size and is no
longer dynamically sized.</li>
<li>However, there are some restrictions on implementing traits for DSTs. For example, methods cannot be generic.</li>
<li>If <code>Self: Sized</code> constraint is present, then it disallows implementing the trait for concrete DSTs.</li>

<h3 id="associated-types-and-vtables"><a class="header" href="#associated-types-and-vtables">Associated Types and Vtables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The point of associated types is that only one exists for any given concrete type. However, the vtable does not know
what the associated type should be because the type is erased.</li>
<li>Trade objects are type erased. You don’t get to keep information about the type it used to be.</li>

<h3 id="the-fromiterator-trait"><a class="header" href="#the-fromiterator-trait">The <code>FromIterator</code> Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>FromIterator</code> trait is implemented by types like <code>Vec</code>. It allows you to collect items from an iterator into a
collection.</li>
<li>The type of the trait is the type of the items of the iterator. However, the <code>FromIterator</code> type itself takes a
generic parameter that represents the type of the iterator.</li>
<li>This poses a problem for trait objects because they cannot have methods that are generic.</li>

<h3 id="extending-with-a-single-bool-add-true-1"><a class="header" href="#extending-with-a-single-bool-add-true-1">Extending with a Single Bool Add True</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The function extends anything that can be extended with an iterator of bools and then tries to extend it with an
iterator that yields a single bool by adding true.</li>
<li>The implementation of extend is generic over the type of items in the iterator.</li>
<li>The implementation of extend is generic over the type of the iterator, which leads to multiple copies of this method
at compile time.</li>
<li>There is no pointer to the appropriate implementation of extend, so there cannot be a v table for din extend.
Therefore, din extend cannot exist.</li>

each t it’s called with to each type that implements extend.</p>
<h3 id="possibility-and-problems"><a class="header" href="#possibility-and-problems">Possibility and Problems</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is tempting to add a monomorphized version of extend for each t it’s called with to each type that implements
extend.</li>
<li>However, it is not always possible because crates that depend on another crate might call extend with even more types,
leading to different v tables for din extends in different crates.</li>
<li>This would result in lots of different v table implementations or lots of different v tables for din extends and make
passing din extends from one crate to another impossible.</li>

made into objects.</p>
<h3 id="traits-and-object-safety"><a class="header" href="#traits-and-object-safety">Traits and Object Safety</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A trait needs to have all of its methods include a receiver that includes self to be object safe.</li>
<li>The trait cannot have a type that returns self, as this would make the return value not sized, which is required for
generating code.</li>
<li>Some traits have methods that are object safe but also have other methods that aren’t. These traits can still be
useful on their own without being made into objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iterator-trait-example"><a class="header" href="#iterator-trait-example">Iterator Trait Example</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The iterator trait has some methods that are object safe, such as next, but also has other methods like chain and
enumerate that return self or are generic, making them non-object safe.</li>
<li>To make the iterator trait object safe, certain methods like chain have where clauses specifying that self is sized,
allowing them to be ignored when using the trait as an object. This allows for a mix of object-safe and
non-object-safe methods in the same trait.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="receiver-requirements"><a class="header" href="#receiver-requirements">Receiver Requirements</a></h3>

<h3 id="dispatchable-functions"><a class="header" href="#dispatchable-functions">Dispatchable Functions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All associative functions must either be dispatchable from a trait object or be explicitly non-dispatchable.</li>
<li>Dispatchable functions require that they don’t have type parameters so they’re not generic.</li>
<li>They have to be a method that does not use the self type right the concrete type except in the type of receiver.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-dispatchable-functions"><a class="header" href="#non-dispatchable-functions">Non-Dispatchable Functions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-dispatchable functions should library writers always consider adding where self is size to non-object safe methods
just in case someone downstream wants to use it as a trait object.</li>
<li>If you have a trait where it is useful even if you could only call the objective methods then it might make sense to
opt-out for the other one so that the trait overall is objective.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iterator-last"><a class="header" href="#iterator-last">Iterator Last</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Iterator last has the size restriction because its receiver doesn’t go behind a reference, it consumes self which
means that it takes self and self is a din iterator which is not sized.</li>

<ul>
<li>The v table for any trait object includes a pointer to the drop function for the concrete type because it’s necessary.</li>
<li>Every v table includes drop, which technically includes extra information such as size and alignment of the concrete

to make these types sized by placing them behind a reference or a pointer.</p>
<h3 id="unsized-types"><a class="header" href="#unsized-types">Unsized Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Din trait, u8, and stir are examples of unsized types.</li>
<li>When placed behind a reference or a pointer, unsized types become a tuple of a pointer to the data and a pointer to
the v table.</li>
<li>U8 becomes sized when placed behind a type that can mask its unsizedness such as box or raw pointers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-unsized-types-sized"><a class="header" href="#making-unsized-types-sized">Making Unsized Types Sized</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To make an unsized type sized, place it behind a type that can mask its unsizedness such as references or boxes.</li>
<li>Box can be used to make an unsized type sized by turning it into a wide pointer where one part is the data and the
other part is the length of the slice.</li>
<li>Dynamically-sized types are special in Rust because they require knowledge about whether their pointers are wide or
not.</li>

<li>Trait alias thin refers to any type that implements pointy where metadata is empty. It has methods for introspecting
the metadata of a pointer.</li>

<ul>
<li>A waker is a struct that has the methods wake, wake by ref will awaken from raw, and you can drop it and clone it.</li>
<li>Inside of a waker is a raw waker. A raw waker if you look inside of it is a data pointer and a v table pointer so it

<ul>
<li><code>fn main</code> can call <code>foo</code> with a closure, but not <code>bar</code>.</li>
<li>The reason is that closures capture data from their environment, so when calling the closure, the address of the

<h3 id="rust-traits-1"><a class="header" href="#rust-traits-1">Rust Traits</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that Rust traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages.</li>

<li>They explain that any is just a trait with a function that returns a unique identifier for a type guaranteed by the
compiler.</li>
<li>Using type id on a trait object over any can give you a unique type identifier for that value, which can be used to
downcast from din any to the concrete type.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-functions-and-closures"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-functions-and-closures">Introduction to Functions and Closures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the topic of functions and closures in Rust. They explain that
there are many different types of function-like things in Rust, and it can be challenging to distinguish between them.
The speaker also mentions their book “Rust for Rustaceans,” which covers intermediate-level topics related to Rust.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-functions-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#types-of-functions-in-rust">Types of Functions in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that being generic over functions is common in Rust, especially when working with callback
functions or writing code in a functional style.</li>
<li>Function pointers are a versatile primitive in Rust that come up frequently.</li>
<li>The type of <code>fn main</code> is a function item, which is subtly different from a function pointer. A function item is a
zero-sized value that references the unique function at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-function-items"><a class="header" href="#understanding-function-items">Understanding Function Items</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When declaring a variable like <code>x = bar</code>, where <code>bar</code> is a function, the resulting type of <code>x</code> is not actually a
function pointer but rather a function item.</li>
<li>A function item is carried around at compile time and references the unique function it represents. If the referenced
function was generic, then using its identifier alone would not uniquely identify it.</li>
<li>While two different instantiations of the same generic function may have identical signatures if thought of as a
function pointer, they are not interchangeable when used as arguments because they reference different unique
functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="function-items-function-pointers-and-closures"><a class="header" href="#function-items-function-pointers-and-closures">Function Items, Function Pointers, and Closures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the differences between function items and function pointers, how they can be
coerced into each other, and introduces closures.</p>
<h3 id="function-items-vs-function-pointers"><a class="header" href="#function-items-vs-function-pointers">Function Items vs. Function Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A function item uniquely identifies a particular instance of a function.</li>
<li>A function pointer is a pointer to a function with a given signature.</li>
<li>Function items are coercible into a function pointer.</li>
<li>Passing in different types to the same named function generates different chunks of code that share the same name but
have distinct bodies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coercion-of-function-items-into-function-pointers"><a class="header" href="#coercion-of-function-items-into-function-pointers">Coercion of Function Items into Function Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compiler coerces the function item type into a function pointer type so that this function can be called.</li>
<li>When calling <code>baz</code> with <code>bar</code>, the compiler coerces the <code>bar</code> function item type into a <code>u32</code> input and output
signature for use as a parameter in <code>baz</code>.</li>
<li>If you never call an instantiated named function like <code>bar</code>, then it’s possible that its code will not be generated by
the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="closures"><a class="header" href="#closures">Closures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Closures are functions that capture their environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-the-fn-traits"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-fn-traits">Understanding the fn Traits</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains the three different traits in Rust that are used to define
functions: <code>fn</code>, <code>fn mut</code>, and <code>fn once</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-different-traits"><a class="header" href="#the-three-different-traits">The Three Different Traits</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code> takes a shared reference to self.</li>
<li><code>fn mut</code> takes an exclusive reference to self. You can only call it once at a time, and you need a mutable reference
to it in the first place.</li>
<li><code>fn once</code> takes an owned reference to self. You can only call it once, and at that point, you’ve moved the value of
the function that you wanted to call.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implications-of-each-trait"><a class="header" href="#implications-of-each-trait">Implications of Each Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you stick an <code>fn mut</code> in an RC, you wouldn’t be able to call it. Similarly, if you’re given a shared reference to
something that’s <code>fn mut</code>, you also cannot call it.</li>
<li>On the other hand, with <code>fn</code>, you can call it multiple times through a shared reference.</li>
<li>Anything that implements <code>fn</code> also implements both <code>f and mute</code> and <code>fn once</code>. However, anything that implements only
one of these two does not implement all three.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="function-pointers"><a class="header" href="#function-pointers">Function Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Function pointers have no state or lifetime associated with them. They don’t care about “self” because they don’t
really contain anything related to “self”.</li>
<li>Function pointers implement all three traits: <code>fn</code>, <code>f and mute</code>, and <code>fn once</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="function-pointers-and-closures"><a class="header" href="#function-pointers-and-closures">Function Pointers and Closures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the hierarchy of function pointers and closures in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-function-pointers"><a class="header" href="#hierarchy-of-function-pointers">Hierarchy of Function Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A function pointer implements <code>fn</code> and therefore also implements <code>f</code>, <code>&amp;fn</code>, <code>&amp;mut fn</code>, and <code>*const fn</code>.</li>
<li>If a function requires an <code>f</code> that implements <code>fn</code>, a bar u32 can be passed in because it coerces to a function
pointer which implements <code>fn</code>.</li>
<li>If the required function is an <code>f</code> and mute, this would still work. Similarly, if it was an <code>f</code> and once, this would
still work.</li>
<li>If the given function is an <code>fn once</code>, it needs to be taken by ownership to call it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="closures-1"><a class="header" href="#closures-1">Closures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A closure takes arguments passed between these brackets <code>{}</code> and has some body that returns the contents of those
arguments.</li>
<li>Non-capturing closures are coercible to function pointers.</li>
<li>Closures that capture from the environment cannot be passed as a parameter to functions that require only a function
pointer.</li>
<li>The compiler generates an anonymous struct for closures that capture over their environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-closures-and-trait-bounds"><a class="header" href="#rust-closures-and-trait-bounds">Rust Closures and Trait Bounds</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how Rust closures work and their trait bounds.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-fn-for-f-closure"><a class="header" href="#implementing-fn-for-f-closure">Implementing fn for f closure</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A closure can implement <code>fn</code> if it is given a shared reference to <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>The implementation will be a copy-paste from the closure definition.</li>
<li>The function pointer alone would not be sufficient; it needs access to the additional state of <code>z</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-fn-mute-for-f-closure"><a class="header" href="#implementing-fn-mute-for-f-closure">Implementing fn mute for f closure</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If the closure is mutable, then it cannot implement <code>fn</code>.</li>
<li>This is because the exclusive reference required by <code>clear()</code> method cannot be captured as a shared reference.</li>
<li>Instead, it can implement <code>fn mute</code>, which requires an exclusive reference to the closure state.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-fn-once-for-f-closure"><a class="header" href="#implementing-fn-once-for-f-closure">Implementing fn once for f closure</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A mutable closure that takes ownership of its environment can implement <code>fn once</code>.</li>
<li>However, calling the closure more than once is not possible since you cannot move z again after moving it into the
closure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closure-capturing"><a class="header" href="#closure-capturing">Closure Capturing</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses closure capturing and how it works in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="move-keyword"><a class="header" href="#move-keyword">Move Keyword</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The move keyword can be used before the definition of a closure to tell the compiler to move a value into the closure.</li>
<li>The compiler determines whether to move an owned or shared reference based on what is needed by the closure.</li>
<li>There are cases where you want to move a value into the closure even though you don’t technically need it. For
example, if you want the closure to drop a value when it exits.</li>
<li>Using move tells the compiler to move a value into the closure, which means that we actually need to own that value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetime-of-closures"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-of-closures">Lifetime of Closures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we specify move for a variable inside a function, its lifetime will be tied to that function’s stack frame.</li>
<li>If we return a closure from a function without specifying its lifetime, Rust assumes that it has static lifetime.
However, this may not always be true since closures can reference variables with non-static lifetimes.</li>
<li>Using move allows us to specify that we want to move a variable into the returned closure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="downsides-of-move"><a class="header" href="#downsides-of-move">Downsides of Move</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using move moves everything specified after it into the closure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moving-and-borrowing-in-closures"><a class="header" href="#moving-and-borrowing-in-closures">Moving and Borrowing in Closures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers how to move some things but borrow other things into closures.</p>
<h3 id="moving-and-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#moving-and-borrowing">Moving and Borrowing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are many ways to express moving and borrowing, such as shadowing or introducing a new scope.</li>
<li>When using closures, you can only choose to move all or nothing.</li>
<li>To specifically move a reference, use a pattern like <code>x</code> which is actually a reference to the real <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>When something is moved into a closure, the closure owns it collectively. The string will be dropped when the closure
is eventually dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-dynamic-dispatch-with-function-traits"><a class="header" href="#using-dynamic-dispatch-with-function-traits">Using Dynamic Dispatch with Function Traits</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers how to use dynamic dispatch with function traits.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch-2"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-dispatch-2">Dynamic Dispatch</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can use function traits through din for dynamic dispatch by specifying the full function signature and
putting <code>in</code> in front of it.</li>
<li>If it’s an f and once, you can still call it as long as you take this as mute.</li>
<li>Box didn’t fn anything did not implement fn because din in general is unsized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-call-for-box-din-fn"><a class="header" href="#implementing-call-for-box-din-fn">Implementing Call for Box Din Fn</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Previously, box din fn did not implement fn due to limitations on the compiler’s ability to reason about such
implementations.</li>
<li>The type of x here is din fn once but this type is not sized so how much space does x take up on the stack here
remember din in general is unsized right it’s not sized um.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dynamically-dispatched-function-traits"><a class="header" href="#dynamically-dispatched-function-traits">Dynamically Dispatched Function Traits</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses dynamically dispatched function traits and the challenges that arise when
trying to call an <code>fn mute</code> using a shared reference.</p>
<h3 id="unsized-r-values"><a class="header" href="#unsized-r-values">Unsized R Values</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An RFC exists for unsized r values, which is required for this implementation to exist.</li>
<li>The RFC has landed, but there are still many implementation questions.</li>
<li>The feature is unstable and can only be used on nightly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dynamically-dispatched-function-traits-1"><a class="header" href="#dynamically-dispatched-function-traits-1">Dynamically Dispatched Function Traits</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you have <code>Box&lt;dyn F&gt;</code> and some <code>F</code> trait, it just works without needing special treatment.</li>
<li>However, if you get something like a <code>dyn F + Mute</code>, all you have is a shared reference to it and therefore cannot
call it because it does not implement <code>F + Mute</code>.</li>
<li>In order to call an <code>fn mute</code>, you need to stick it behind a shared reference. In order to call an <code>fn</code>, all you need
is a shared reference. In order to call an <code>fn once</code>, you actually need a wide pointer type that allows you to take
ownership.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arc-din-fn-implementation"><a class="header" href="#arc-din-fn-implementation">Arc Din Fn Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no implementation of arc din fn yet, even though the intuition built up so far suggests that it should exist.</li>
<li>An arc supports unsized values and can hold the din fn. If it’s able to give you a shared reference to the closure
state, then it should be implemented as fn because all that requires is being able to get a shared reference to the
closure state.</li>
<li>There might be an implementation missing due to issues with unsized r values or maybe specialized for box.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="const-generics"><a class="header" href="#const-generics">Const Generics</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses const generics and how they can be used to make generic types
that are only usable with const evaluatable functions.</p>
<h3 id="defining-a-closure-that-returns-zero"><a class="header" href="#defining-a-closure-that-returns-zero">Defining a Closure that Returns Zero</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker defines a closure that returns zero.</li>
<li>This closure is a constant closure that can be evaluated at compile time.</li>
<li>The speaker explains that this closure is equivalent to <code>make_zero</code> which returns a <code>u32</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-const-evaluatable-functions-in-generic-types"><a class="header" href="#using-const-evaluatable-functions-in-generic-types">Using Const Evaluatable Functions in Generic Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker wants to define a generic type <code>foo</code> that takes an <code>fn once</code>.</li>
<li>However, the compiler does not know if the function is callable as a const.</li>
<li>There is currently no way to take any type that implements a trait but only using things that are const evaluatable.</li>
<li>There is an interesting pre-RFC discussion about whether there is a way to do this.</li>
<li>The speaker proposes syntax for opting into this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opting-into-experimental-features"><a class="header" href="#opting-into-experimental-features">Opting into Experimental Features</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker adds experimental features and runs cargo r to see what happens.</li>
<li>Rust analyzer gets confused because it doesn’t know about these features.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-foo-callable-with-x"><a class="header" href="#making-foo-callable-with-x">Making Foo Callable with X</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If foo calls x, rust analyzer throws an error because main isn’t const.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="const-functions-and-closures"><a class="header" href="#const-functions-and-closures">Const Functions and Closures</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses const functions and closures in Rust. They explain how const
functions work, what can be called within them, and how closures can be used with const functions.</p>
<h3 id="const-functions"><a class="header" href="#const-functions">Const Functions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In a <code>const fn</code> of <code>n</code>, only things that are themselves constant can be called.</li>
<li>Const functions require that everything they call is also const.</li>
<li>If the closure is itself constant or constant evaluatable, then it should also be callable from cons context.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="error-reporting"><a class="header" href="#error-reporting">Error Reporting</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The error reporting doesn’t know about the const flag yet.</li>
<li>This kind of bound is not stabilized, so error reporting doesn’t know about it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complicated-lifetime-bounds"><a class="header" href="#complicated-lifetime-bounds">Complicated Lifetime Bounds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you end up with complicated lifetime bounds with 4r.</li>
<li>You usually have to specify lifetimes when something returns. If we were to try to specify what the lifetimes are
here, what actually is it? This is where you get this special for syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rare-use-of-for-bound"><a class="header" href="#rare-use-of-for-bound">Rare Use of For Bound</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>for</code> bound should hold for any lifetime. It’s very rare that you actually need to give a <code>for</code> bound like this.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses passing closures to async functions and how it relates to
static closures.</p>
<h3 id="closure-capture-and-environment"><a class="header" href="#closure-capture-and-environment">Closure Capture and Environment</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When passing a closure to an async function, the closure does not need to be static.</li>
<li>Usually with futures, especially if you want to do something like Tokio spawn of the future you get back then Tokio
spawn just like thread spawn requires that the argument is like static.</li>
<li>If f here is not static then the return future will also not be static right if we sort of think of the de-sugaring of
this right it’s fn this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="input-lifetime-and-output-type"><a class="header" href="#input-lifetime-and-output-type">Input Lifetime and Output Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The desugaring of impul future captures lifetime inputs automatically.</li>
<li>Impul trait just like async fn automatically captures the lifetime of its inputs so if this input is tied to some
lifetime then the output type will also be tied to that same lifetime which means it will not be static unless the
input is static.</li>
<li>You often need to pin things manually in general a weight syntax should take care of you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spawning-futures"><a class="header" href="#spawning-futures">Spawning Futures</a></h2>

longer than their current stack frame.</p>
<h3 id="pinning-futures"><a class="header" href="#pinning-futures">Pinning Futures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you try to do something like spawning where the future needs to live longer than the current stack frame um you
often need to pin it i mean you should very rarely need to pin things manually in general a weight syntax should take
care of you.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces a new type called “String Split” and explains its purpose.
They also discuss how to implement the iterator trait for this type.</p>
<h3 id="building-string-split"><a class="header" href="#building-string-split">Building String Split</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to create a new type called “String Split” that will have a method called “string split”.</li>
<li>The method will take in two parameters: haystack (the string being searched) and delimiter (the string used to split
haystack).</li>
<li>The method will return an object of a special type that refers to the name of the input lock.</li>
<li>Using “self” instead of “that” is useful because it means that if we rename the type later, we don’t have to change
all the return types of the methods.</li>
<li>The iterator trait allows you to use for loops with your custom types.</li>
<li>To implement iterator for String Split, you need to define a next function that takes a mutable reference to self and
returns an optional item.</li>
<li>A test can be written by creating some string like ABCDE and using stir split on it with space as delimiter.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how lifetimes work in Rust and why they are important.</p>
<h3 id="how-pointers-work-with-iterators"><a class="header" href="#how-pointers-work-with-iterators">How Pointers Work with Iterators</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust calls iterators’ <code>next</code> method and gets back a pointer to a string.</li>
<li>Rust needs to know how long it’s okay to keep using this pointer for because it might use that pointer after the
string it’s pointing to has already gone away.</li>
<li>The tick a is really a lifetime. It represents how long does this reference live for.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetime-of-references"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-of-references">Lifetime of References</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a store split then the remainder and delimiter both live for the same lifetime.</li>
<li>The thing that we return has the same lifetime as tick a.</li>
<li>Even after you drop the store split, the thing that you get back from the iterator is still valid because it’s about
the lifetime of the string we were originally given.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specifying-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#specifying-lifetimes">Specifying Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can never be wrong by specifying lifetimes. If you specify a lifetime that the compiler thinks is wrong, it won’t
let you compile your program.</li>
<li>Anonymous lifetimes are places where you tell the compiler to guess what lifetime. This only works when there’s only
one possible guess.</li>
<li>You can order lifetimes based on how long they are. For example, take static is a ring that lives for the entire
duration of the rest of the program.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-26"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-26">Conclusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The name you give does not matter; it’s just like naming generics.</li>

<h3 id="what-are-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#what-are-lifetimes">What are Lifetimes?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lifetimes are a way of ensuring that references in Rust are valid.</li>
<li>You can use an underscore to tell the compiler not to consider a certain lifetime for guessing purposes.</li>
<li>You can specify an order for lifetimes if necessary.</li>
<li>The tick underscore is only used if there’s only one possible lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anonymous-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-lifetimes">Anonymous Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous lifetimes can be used to simplify code by allowing type inference to determine the correct lifetime.</li>
<li>This means that the output position will have its lifetime inferred based on the input position.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetime-errors"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-errors">Lifetime Errors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime errors occur when there is a mismatch between the expected and actual lifetimes of references.</li>
<li>The error message will indicate which reference has an incorrect lifetime and where it was defined.</li>
<li>To fix these errors, you need to ensure that all references have compatible lifetimes.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the use of generic names for lifetimes and not proper names
like typical variables. They also talk about how resilient anonymous lifetimes are and whether relying too much on them
can cause trouble.</p>
<h3 id="generic-names-for-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#generic-names-for-lifetimes">Generic Names for Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that generic names are used for lifetimes instead of proper names like typical variables.</li>
<li>They mention that anonymous lifetimes are resilient and can be relied upon most of the time.</li>
<li>It is possible to give more than one lifetime and then give relationships between them using restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relationship-between-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#relationship-between-lifetimes">Relationship Between Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker mentions that it is possible to give relationships between lifetimes by saying a reference must live
longer than another reference.</li>
<li>Lifetimes are types, and they can be thought of as subtyping.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#static-lifetime">Static Lifetime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The static lifetime extends until the end of the program, and any value has a lifetime of however long that value is
assigned to a variable or moved.</li>
<li>If you have a reference or something containing any lifetime, you can assign anything of the same type but with a
longer lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-27"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-27">Conclusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker concludes by stating that everything defaults to having a static lifetime, although it’s not entirely
true. A value’s lifetime lasts until it’s moved or assigned to a variable.</li>

<ul>
<li>Running <code>cargo check</code> shows an error where we’re trying to return a value referencing a temporary value.</li>
<li>The error is caused by returning a string reference that is tied to the lifetime of another string.</li>
<li>The issue arises because Rust assumes that both strings have the same lifetime, but they don’t.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that heap allocation is used to copy all characters over to create a string.</li>
<li>Storing the delimiter as a string requires an allocation, which is not great for performance. It also ties it to an
allocator, making it incompatible with embedded devices.</li>
<li>A question is asked about getting a character from <code>until_car</code> and transforming it back into a string. The reference
in front of the format produces a string, and <code>ref</code> takes a reference to that.</li>

<h3 id="multiple-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#multiple-lifetimes">Multiple Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that when using references, their lifetime must be tied to the correct object’s lifetime.</li>
<li>To fix this issue, multiple lifetimes are needed. Naming these lifetimes allows for generic implementation over
haystack and delimiter.</li>
<li>By having different lifetimes for haystack and delimiter, the compiler no longer forces them to be the same by
downgrading the lifetime.</li>
<li>The reference given back is now tied only to the haystack lifetime instead of being tied to both haystack and
delimiter.</li>

<li>Iterated over all characters of the string looking for one that is the character we’re searching for and then when it
finds whatever results it finds if it finds one we map that sum to take the position and return that position and that
position plus one right because the character is only one character long.</li>
<li>Implemented this pattern for all sorts of other types so anything that can find itself in a string will now just work.</li>

<h2 id="qa"><a class="header" href="#qa">Q&amp;A</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker answers some questions from viewers about various aspects of the
implementation.</p>
<h3 id="questions-and-answers"><a class="header" href="#questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Explained what self refers to in pattern self here in the implementation down here. It’s a reference to this type so
it’s a reference to a reference to Astor.</li>
<li>Discussed whether there is a simpler way than character indices. There is but this shows the concept of it like you
can do way more efficient things than this.</li>
<li>Clarified whether <code>find(self)</code> returns <code>self</code> or its index. Find as a method on strings that you can give it a string
and it will tell you the start of that string in that string that plus one is wrong and will panic your code.</li>
<li>Explained why <code>self.len()</code> and not <code>s.len()</code>. Self is the thing we’re searching for, it’s the length of the delimiter.
In order to find the end of the delimiter, it has to be the start of the delimiter plus the length of the delimiter
not the length of the string we’re searching in. The s here is what we’re searching in.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-cell"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-cell">Introduction to Cell</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the Rust standard library module called Cell.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-cell-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-cell-1">Introduction to Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that the Cell module is a shareable mutable container.</li>
<li>They mention that this might sound weird in Rust because of its shared reference and exclusive reference concepts.</li>
<li>However, the module allows for interior mutability in a controlled fashion under certain constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starting-with-sell"><a class="header" href="#starting-with-sell">Starting with Sell</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about starting with Sell since it has the least amount of
quirkiness among the smart pointer types.</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-sell-1"><a class="header" href="#starting-with-sell-1">Starting with Sell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that they will start with Sell since it’s less quirky than other smart pointer types.</li>
<li>They mention that there are various container types in Rust’s standard library that allow for interior mutability.</li>
<li>These containers are often referred to as shareable mutable containers or interior immutability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interior-mutability-and-cell"><a class="header" href="#interior-mutability-and-cell">Interior Mutability and Cell</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses interior mutability and exclusive or shared references. They
then introduce the concept of a cell in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-cell-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-cell-2">Introduction to Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A cell provides interior mutability in Rust.</li>
<li>You can create a new cell with a value of some type T.</li>
<li>The set method allows you to change the value inside the cell using an immutable reference.</li>
<li>The swap method lets you swap values between two cells.</li>
<li>The replace method replaces the value inside the cell with a new one.</li>
<li>The into_inner method consumes self, assuming ownership of the cell.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="restrictions-of-cell-types"><a class="header" href="#restrictions-of-cell-types">Restrictions of Cell Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Different types of cells have different restrictions on what can be stored inside them and how they can be used.</li>
<li>As you move towards mutex, there is more freedom to store whatever you want but also more overhead involved in making
it work.</li>
<li>Box does not provide interior mutability. If you have a shared reference to a box, you cannot mutate its contents.</li>
<li>There is no way to tell externally from a type whether it has interior mutability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safety-features-of-cell"><a class="header" href="#safety-features-of-cell">Safety Features of Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>With Cell, there is no way to get a reference to what’s inside the cell itself. This means that if no one else has a
pointer to the value stored in the cell, changing it is safe.</li>
<li>Cell does not implement sync. This means that if you have a reference to a cell, you cannot give away that reference
to another thread.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="borrowing-and-exclusive-reference"><a class="header" href="#borrowing-and-exclusive-reference">Borrowing and Exclusive Reference</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:10:59s"></a> You cannot use an exclusive reference in general with a cell.</li>
<li>If you have an exclusive reference to the cell, you can get an exclusive reference to the value inside.</li>
<li>At that point, you cannot get or change the value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-using-cell"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-using-cell">Benefits of Using Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:11:19s"></a> The benefit of using cell is that you can have multiple shared references to a thing.</li>
<li>Cell is usually used with something like RC where you want the cell to be stored in multiple places or pointers to
it’d be stored in multiple places like in some data structure like imagine a graph where some of the things might
share a value right then you might have multiple references to a thing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-of-cell"><a class="header" href="#usage-of-cell">Usage of Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:02s"></a> Cell should usually just be used for small copy types.</li>
<li>You can only get the value out of a cell either if you have a mutable reference to it or if the value is copy.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker demonstrates how to implement sell ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="basic-api"><a class="header" href="#basic-api">Basic API</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need a pub struct called “cell” which holds a T.</li>
<li>We will implement:
<ul>
<li>A new function which takes a value of type T and returns self. This gives us a cell that contains the given value.</li>
<li>A set function which takes an immutable reference to self and a value T. It sets self.value equal to value but
currently will not work because we are trying to assign to self.value which is behind a shared reference and so we
can’t modify it.</li>
<li>A get function which returns a T. This is like the basic API we are going for.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:15:06s"></a> At the core of almost all of these types to provide interior mutability is a special cell type called
unsafe cell.</li>
<li>We will use cell unsafe cell so that the value here is an unsafe cell. That’s the only way that we can actually mutate
something through a shared reference.</li>
<li>Cell is usually used for smaller values like numbers or flags that need to be mutated from multiple different places.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-unsafe-cell"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-unsafe-cell">Introduction to Unsafe Cell</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the concept of unsafe cell and explains how it can be used to
dereference a raw pointer.</p>
<h3 id="using-unsafe-cell"><a class="header" href="#using-unsafe-cell">Using Unsafe Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The value of unsafe cell is just unsafe sell new values.</li>
<li>Trying to dereference a raw pointer is currently incorrect because the compiler doesn’t know if anyone else is
mutating that value.</li>
<li>Writing “unsafe” here tells the compiler that we have checked that no one else is currently mutating this value.
However, this code will be rejected if two threads try to write to a value at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-not-sync-for-cell-t"><a class="header" href="#implementing-not-sync-for-cell-t">Implementing Not Sync for Cell T</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to implement not sync for cell T and tell the compiler that you can never share a cell across threads.</li>
<li>Unsafe cell itself is not sync, which means that cell is not sync. Therefore, this unsafe code will be rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recap-of-unsafe-cell"><a class="header" href="#recap-of-unsafe-cell">Recap of Unsafe Cell</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>The cell type allows you to modify a value through a shared reference because no other threads have a reference to it.</li>
<li>Get returns a copy of the value stored inside so even if we change the value, we don’t have to invalidate any

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the problem of interleaving threads and how it can lead to
corrupted arrays.</p>
<h3 id="interleaving-threads"><a class="header" href="#interleaving-threads">Interleaving Threads</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When two threads are modifying the same bit of memory at the same time, there is no guarantee that they won’t step on
each other.</li>
<li>If one thread writes its value and then goes to sleep while another thread runs for a while and then goes to sleep,
we’ll see an interleaving of values.</li>
<li>This can result in a corrupted array that contains some values that were never set by either thread.</li>
<li>The underlying memory system being fast enough can prevent this from happening in practice, but it’s still a potential
issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demonstrating-the-problem"><a class="header" href="#demonstrating-the-problem">Demonstrating the Problem</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By running a test where two threads increment a shared value 100,000 times each, we can demonstrate how interleaving
threads can cause lost modifications.</li>
<li>Because both threads are modifying the same value at the same time, some modifications end up being lost.</li>
<li>This results in an incorrect final value for the shared variable.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses why non-copy types don’t require trait bounds and why putting
trait bounds only where they’re needed is more idiomatic in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="copy-trait-requirement"><a class="header" href="#copy-trait-requirement">Copy Trait Requirement</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A question is asked about why non-copy types are allowed if only the get method requires copy types.</li>
<li>The speaker explains that generally only putting trait bounds where they’re needed is more idiomatic in Rust.</li>
<li>Putting trait bounds on every type that contains a cell would result in extraneous bounds all over the place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constrained-trait-bounds"><a class="header" href="#constrained-trait-bounds">Constrained Trait Bounds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By putting trait bounds only where they’re needed (i.e. on methods like get), callers only have to worry about those
constraints when they’re actually using those methods.</li>
<li>This is usually the most constrained space and makes for cleaner code.</li>

<ul>
<li>Unsafe cell is a special type in Rust that allows you to mutate data even if it’s shared.</li>
<li>You cannot cast a shared reference into an exclusive reference without going through unsafe cell because the Rust
compiler optimizes your code and how it interacts with LLVM.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ref-cell"><a class="header" href="#ref-cell">Ref Cell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ref cell is a type of immutable memory location with dynamically checked borrow rules.</li>
<li>It lets you check at runtime whether anyone else is mutating this value, which is useful for traversing graphs or
trees where there might be cycles.</li>
<li>The ref cell has a method called borrow which takes a shared reference to self and gives you an option reference to T.
It also has a borrow mute method that initially makes both methods return None.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the implementation of a ref type and a ref mute type to solve
the problem of shared and exclusive references.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-ref-type"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-ref-type">Implementation of Ref Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A ref type is created with a lifetime that points to the ref cell.</li>
<li>The ref cell contains a reference to the inner value.</li>
<li>When a ref is dropped, the reference count is decremented.</li>
<li>If there are no shared references left, then it becomes unshared.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deref-trait-1"><a class="header" href="#deref-trait-1">Deref Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Deref trait allows for automatic dereferencing into an inner type.</li>
<li>Given a reference to self, it returns a reference to the target type T.</li>
<li>This allows calling any method that requires a reference of T on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safety-argument-1"><a class="header" href="#safety-argument-1">Safety Argument</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The safety argument is updated to say that the ref is only created if no exclusive references have been given out.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains RefCell and Rc in Rust programming language.</p>
<h3 id="refcell"><a class="header" href="#refcell">RefCell</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>RefCell allows for mutable data to be shared between multiple owners.</li>
<li>RefMut is only created if no other references have been given out once it is given out state is set to exclusive so no
future references are given out so we have an exclusive lease on the inner value so dereferencing is fine mutable or
immutable EDD referencing is fine.</li>
<li>Safety here is see safety 4d refute.</li>
<li>It’s common practice to write safety comments for every unsafe use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rc"><a class="header" href="#rc">RC</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>RC provides shared ownership of a value of type T allocated in the heap.</li>
<li>Shared references in rust disallow mutation by default and RC is no exception.</li>
<li>RC never provides mutability all it does is allow you to have multiple shared references to a thing and only
deallocate it when the last one goes away.</li>
<li>RC is not thread safe, but even on a single thread, this can be useful often again in the context of data structures
or things like graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rc-and-smart-pointers"><a class="header" href="#rc-and-smart-pointers">RC and Smart Pointers</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains the difference between weak and strong pointers. They then
introduce RC (Reference Counted) smart pointers and explain how they work.</p>
<h3 id="weak-vs-strong-pointers"><a class="header" href="#weak-vs-strong-pointers">Weak vs Strong Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A weak pointer will not prevent an object from being deleted, whereas a strong pointer will.</li>
<li>Weak smart pointers need to be upgraded to a real pointer before use, but this upgrade can fail.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introduction-to-rc-smart-pointers"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-rc-smart-pointers">Introduction to RC Smart Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An RC is a pointer to some type T that is stored on the heap.</li>
<li>The value needs to be stored on the heap because if multiple functions in the code reference it, it cannot be on the
stack of any given function.</li>
<li>The reference count has to be in the value that is shared amongst all copies of the RC.</li>
<li>An RC inner holds both the value and reference count.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-clone-for-t"><a class="header" href="#implementing-clone-for-t">Implementing Clone for T</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloning an RC increases its reference count without copying its inner value.</li>
<li>DRF (Dereference), implemented for RCT, works similarly for RC by returning a raw pointer to T.</li>
<li>This implementation requires unsafe blocks because Rust’s compiler does not know whether a pointer is still valid.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-reference-types"><a class="header" href="#rust-reference-types">Rust Reference Types</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses reference types in Rust and the semantics that must be followed
when using them.</p>
<h3 id="reference-types"><a class="header" href="#reference-types">Reference Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ref Mew T, Star Mew T, Star Consti So Star Mute and Star Const are not references but raw pointers.</li>
<li>Ampersand symbol means a shared reference. Ampersand mute means an exclusive reference.</li>
<li>The star versions of these like star constants star mute do not have guarantees. If you have a raw pointer, the only
thing you can really do to it is use an unsafe block to dereference it and turn it into a reference.</li>
<li>The difference between star constant and star mute is fuzzy. A star mute is usually something that you might be able
to mutate something you might have an exclusive exclusive reference to whereas the star constant is intended to
signify that you will never mutate this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="box-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#box-in-rust">Box in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses what box provides for us in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="box-provides-heap-allocation"><a class="header" href="#box-provides-heap-allocation">Box Provides Heap Allocation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Box provides heap allocation which lets us go from our Zener which would otherwise be on the stack to a pointer that
is on the heap which is what we store here.</li>
<li>For clone here we’re going to increase the reference count but here we have the same problem as we did for ref cell
right which is we have a shared reference to self but we need to mutate something inside of it and so here lo and
behold the problem is the answer is the same thing that we’ve done before it’s our friend cell.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unsafe-keyword-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-keyword-in-rust">Unsafe Keyword in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the unsafe keyword in Rust and its meaning.</p>
<h3 id="unsafe-keyword"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-keyword">Unsafe Keyword</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The unsafe keyword is a little weird because really what it means is I have checked that the stuff inside the brackets
is safe. It’s like I as the programmer certified that this is safe so it’s not really unsafe.</li>
<li>It’s like in some sense saying that I acknowledge that this code seems unsafe but it’s actually safe so I agree with
you it’s a little bit of a weird keyword name.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-pointers-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#smart-pointers-in-rust">Smart Pointers in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses smart pointers in Rust and how to deallocate them.</p>
<h3 id="deallocating-smart-pointers"><a class="header" href="#deallocating-smart-pointers">Deallocating Smart Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When an RC goes away we need to make sure that when the last RC goes away then we actually deallocate otherwise there
will be a memory leak.</li>
<li>We are going to check with the countess if the count is one we are being dropped for after us there will be no RCS and
no references to tea otherwise there are other references there are other RCS so don’t drop the box.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-variance-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-variance-in-rust">Understanding Variance in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains variance in Rust and how it relates to star-mutant-star-const.
They also introduce non-null as a way to optimize code.</p>
<h3 id="variance-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#variance-in-rust">Variance in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Variance is one of the primary differences between star mutant star const.</li>
<li>Non-null is used for optimization purposes because it allows the compiler to know that a pointer cannot be null.</li>
<li>Option non-null can use the null pointer to represent none without any overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-non-null"><a class="header" href="#using-non-null">Using Non-Null</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The standard library has a neat thing called non-null that we can use instead of using star mute.</li>
<li>We give it a storm utage from box from raw and use it to get back this star mutti which is what we need for into raw.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-unsafe-pointers-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#using-unsafe-pointers-in-rust">Using Unsafe Pointers in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to use unsafe pointers in Rust and why they are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="using-unsafe-rf-method-on-non-null"><a class="header" href="#using-unsafe-rf-method-on-non-null">Using Unsafe RF Method on Non Null</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We can use the unsafe RF method on non-null instead of having this star ampersand star thing.</li>
<li>This is obviously unsafe, but we know that we’re keeping the reference count correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-unsafe-pointers-are-necessary"><a class="header" href="#why-unsafe-pointers-are-necessary">Why Unsafe Pointers are Necessary</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compiler doesn’t know that we have the last pointer and therefore that it’s safe to turn this back into a box and
drop it.</li>
<li>We know because we know that we’re keeping the reference count correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lifetime-guarantees-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-guarantees-in-rust">Lifetime Guarantees in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains lifetime guarantees in Rust and why you cannot store mutable
references outside their scope.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-cannot-store-mutable-references-outside-their-scope"><a class="header" href="#why-you-cannot-store-mutable-references-outside-their-scope">Why You Cannot Store Mutable References Outside Their Scope</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you tried to stick the mutable reference you got back from mute somewhere and then dropped the ref mute and then
tried to use this mutable reference again, the compiler would say no that’s not allowed.</li>
<li>You’re trying to use this mutable reference after the lifetime it’s tied to has already expired because the refuge has
gone away.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="difference-between-mutable-pointer-and-mutable-reference"><a class="header" href="#difference-between-mutable-pointer-and-mutable-reference">Difference Between Mutable Pointer and Mutable Reference</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A mutable pointer is just a pointer with certain semantics and we call it star mute.</li>
<li>It does not carry the additional implication that it’s exclusive which is what allows you to mutate through things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-memory-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-memory-in-rust">Understanding Memory in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how memory works in Rust and why a cell is necessary even if
there is a mutable pointer.</p>
<h3 id="why-a-cell-is-necessary-even-if-there-is-a-mutable-pointer"><a class="header" href="#why-a-cell-is-necessary-even-if-there-is-a-mutable-pointer">Why a Cell is Necessary Even if There is a Mutable Pointer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have a mutable pointer but it’s not safe for us to mutate through it.</li>
<li>This is the difference between a mutable pointer and a mutable reference.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="inner-dog-ref-count"><a class="header" href="#inner-dog-ref-count">Inner Dog Ref Count</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why it’s important to add a marker in Rust when a type owns
another type. They also discuss how accessing something through a pointer that has just been deallocated can cause
issues.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-marker-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#importance-of-marker-in-rust">Importance of Marker in Rust</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to add a marker in Rust when a type owns another type.</li>
<li>If someone later comes along and writes code that accesses something through the pointer that was just deallocated,
the compiler won’t warn them that this isn’t okay.</li>
<li>This is because they won’t know that this is the case if there isn’t a marker present.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drop-check-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#drop-check-in-rust">Drop Check in Rust</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The speaker introduces drop check in Rust and explains why it’s important to implement RC properly.</li>
<li>Drop check is used by Rust to ensure that types are dropped in the correct order.</li>
<li>If types are not dropped in the correct order, it can lead to errors and crashes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-drop-check-issue"><a class="header" href="#example-of-drop-check-issue">Example of Drop Check Issue</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The speaker provides an example of how drop check can cause issues if not implemented properly.</li>
<li>They explain how dropping foo calls a method on the string through its drop implementation, but since drop is
implicit, it can lead to problems if types are not dropped in the correct order.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-drop-check"><a class="header" href="#understanding-drop-check">Understanding Drop Check</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker goes into more detail about drop check and how it works. They provide
examples of how incorrect use of drop check can lead to errors and crashes.</p>
<h2 id="how-drop-check-works"><a class="header" href="#how-drop-check-works">How Drop Check Works</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>When functions or any type gets dropped, Rust assumes that every use of that type is a test of use for all fields
contained within it.</li>
<li>This means that even if drop is not explicitly written, Rust will treat it as if it’s accessing every field of the
type.</li>
<li>If types are dropped in the wrong order, Rust will catch this as a problem and throw an error.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-drop-check-issue-1"><a class="header" href="#example-of-drop-check-issue-1">Example of Drop Check Issue</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The speaker provides another example of how incorrect use of drop check can lead to errors.</li>
<li>They explain how dropping foo before T can cause issues because foo holds a reference to T.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-phantom-data-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-phantom-data-in-rust">Understanding Phantom Data in Rust</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains the concept of phantom data in Rust and how it is used to ensure that the
dropping of an RC is checked at compile time.</p>
<h2 id="phantom-data"><a class="header" href="#phantom-data">Phantom Data</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Phantom data tells Rust to treat a type as though there is one even though there is only a pointer to it.</li>
<li>It ensures that when we drop an RC, we treat it as dropping one of these types.</li>
<li>The marker is needed when T is not static, but we want to allow any T here.</li>
<li>The wrapper internally in the standard library was added to guard against someone accidentally writing an
implementation for RC in ER.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="question-mark-sized-types"><a class="header" href="#question-mark-sized-types">Question Mark Sized Types</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Question mark sized types are used to opt-out of the requirement that every generic argument must be sized.</li>
<li>Coerce incised trait deals with some of the restrictions of why it’s hard for you to implement RC Foley yourself if
you want to support dynamically sized types.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-rust-over-c"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-using-rust-over-c">Benefits of Using Rust Over C</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Writing convoluted code like this rarely happens in your own code.</li>
<li>In Rust, these problems are caught at compile time rather than run time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="refcell-mutex-and-arc"><a class="header" href="#refcell-mutex-and-arc">RefCell, Mutex and Arc</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the difference between exclamation marks sized and question mark sized. It also
explains how synchronous versions of RefCell, Mutex and Arc work.</p>
<h2 id="exclamation-marks-sized-vs-question-mark-sized"><a class="header" href="#exclamation-marks-sized-vs-question-mark-sized">Exclamation Marks Sized vs Question Mark Sized</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Exclamation mark sized means not sized.</li>
<li>Question mark size means it does not have to be sized.</li>
<li>Default is that everything has a size bound.</li>
<li>Opt out of that bound by using exclamation marks or question marks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synchronous-versions-of-refcell-mutex-and-arc"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-versions-of-refcell-mutex-and-arc">Synchronous Versions of RefCell, Mutex and Arc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Strategies written so far don’t quite work right in the cell case if you have multiple threads to can mutate at the
same time there just is no equivalent of cell because even though you’re not giving out references to things having
two threads modify the same type at the same value at the same time it’s just not okay so actually is no thread-safe
version of cell refs l is a little interesting so in the ref cell we wrote right you have borrow and borrow mute and
they return options you could totally implement a thread-safe version of ref cell one that uses an atomic counter
instead of cell for these numbers.</li>
<li>Thread-safe version of ref cell uses an atomic counter instead of a cell for these numbers. CPU has built-in
instructions that can increment and decrement counters in a thread safe way.</li>
<li>Multi-threaded or synchronized version of RefCell is usually our W lock.</li>
<li>Reader/writer lock (R/W lock), which is one type in sync, is basically a ref cell where counters are kept using
Atomics so they are thread-safe but also borrow and borrow mute which in the reader/writer lock are called read and
write they don’t return an option instead they always return the ref for the ref mute but what they do is they block
the current thread if the borrow can’t succeed yet so they block the current thread until the conditions are met.</li>
<li>Mutex is a simplified version of RefCell where there’s only borrow mute as you don’t need to keep all these extra
counts for how many readers or how many shared references there are it’s just either it some other thread has a
reference to it or some of the threads is not and it similarly has blocking behavior where when you call lock on a
mutex it will block until there are no other references to the inner value and at that point you’re given that
reference and it similarly has a guard the same way ref cell does.</li>
<li>Arc (Atomic Reference Count) is pretty much exactly the same as our C except that it uses these thread safe operations
these atomic CPU Atomics for managing the reference count rather than a cell. It cannot be sent because if I sent an
RC to some other thread and that other thread dropped the RC and I dropped an RC at the same time both of us would try
to use cell to decrement count but that’s obviously not okay because cell is not thread safe. Non-null is also not
send by default.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rc-vs-art"><a class="header" href="#rc-vs-art">RC vs Art</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses why one might prefer RC over Art.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-using-atomics"><a class="header" href="#cost-of-using-atomics">Cost of Using Atomics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>RC is cheaper than Art.</li>
<li>Atomics are more expensive in terms of CPU cycles and coordination overhead between cores.</li>
<li>Non-thread safe versions are preferred because they have lower overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asynchronous-mutexes"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-mutexes">Asynchronous Mutexes</a></h2>

<li>Async Std, Tokyo, Futures crate, and Futures Intrusive crate all have asynchronous mutexes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-cow-type"><a class="header" href="#the-cow-type">The Cow Type</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the Cow type and its implementation.</p>
<h2 id="copy-on-write"><a class="header" href="#copy-on-write">Copy-On-Write</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Cow type is an enum that is either owned or borrowed.</li>
<li>If a Cow of T contains a reference to a T, it passes access through. If it owns the thing it contains, it gives you a
reference to that.</li>
<li>If you want to modify the value inside of a copy-on-write when it’s just holding a reference, you can’t modify it
because it’s shared.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-cow-type"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-cow-type">Benefits of Cow Type</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cow allows for modification only when necessary by cloning the value and turning it into the owned version.</li>
<li>It’s useful when most of the time you don’t need a copy because you’re only going to read but sometimes you need to
modify it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="example-escape-function-with-cow-type"><a class="header" href="#example-escape-function-with-cow-type">Example: Escape Function with Cow Type</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section provides an example use case for the Cow type in an escape function.</p>
<h2 id="escaping-function-with-string-input"><a class="header" href="#escaping-function-with-string-input">Escaping Function with String Input</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>An escape function takes a string and returns the string.</li>
<li>Cow is useful in this case because if you don’t have to modify it, you just pass it through. Only if you do have to
change something do you clone and mutate it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="from-utf-8-lossy"><a class="header" href="#from-utf-8-lossy">From Utf-8 Lossy</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses why from_utf8_lossy returns Cow but other UTF variants don’t.</p>
<h2 id="from-utf-8-lossy-1"><a class="header" href="#from-utf-8-lossy-1">From Utf-8 Lossy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The reason from_utf8_lossy returns Cow is that if the given byte string is completely valid utf-8, it can just pass it
straight through.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cow-type-and-smart-pointers"><a class="header" href="#cow-type-and-smart-pointers">Cow Type and Smart Pointers</a></h1>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the cow type and smart pointers in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="cow-type"><a class="header" href="#cow-type">Cow Type</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The cow type allows you to avoid allocation if you don’t need to modify.</li>
<li>Other from UTA types usually allocate regardless, but with the cow type, there is no reason to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-pointers"><a class="header" href="#smart-pointers">Smart Pointers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust has several smart pointer types.</li>
<li>Cell is for non-thread safe non-reference interior mutability.</li>
<li>Ref cell is for dynamic interior mutability.</li>
<li>RC is for dynamically shared references where you don’t know how many references are going to be or when the inner
value will be dropped at runtime.</li>
<li>There are also thread-safe versions of these types called synchronized versions.</li>
<li>Cow is not really a smart pointer but kind of a copy-on-write pointer that upgrades when needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction-18"><a class="header" href="#introduction-18">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the topic of the stream and explains why sorting algorithms are important.</p>
<h3 id="sorting-algorithms-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#sorting-algorithms-in-rust">Sorting Algorithms in Rust</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sorting algorithms are commonly used in computer science education and coding interviews.</li>
<li>The purpose of this stream is to show how sorting algorithms can be implemented in Rust in an idiomatic way.</li>
<li>The speaker will take questions as they go along and may stumble upon interesting Rust topics while implementing these algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ord-trait"><a class="header" href="#ord-trait">Ord Trait</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the Ord trait in Rust and its importance for sorting algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="partial-ord-vs-ord"><a class="header" href="#partial-ord-vs-ord">Partial Ord vs. Ord</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Partial Ord is a partial ordering that allows types to be compared with other similar types.</li>
<li>Ord requires that a type forms a total order, meaning it must always have an answer when comparing two elements.</li>
<li>The reason for using Ord instead of Partial Ord for sorting is because it’s hard to order things if the order of some things in that set doesn’t matter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="total-order"><a class="header" href="#total-order">Total Order</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Total order requires that things are transitive and always have an answer when comparing two elements.</li>
<li>Using total order has some weird properties because there are certain types in Rust that don’t form a total order.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-31"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-31">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes the stream by summarizing what was covered and mentioning future streams.</p>
<h3 id="recap-2"><a class="header" href="#recap-2">Recap</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this stream was to show how sorting algorithms can be implemented in Rust.</li>
<li>The speaker used the Ord trait instead of Partial Ord for sorting because it’s easier to order things when their order matters.</li>
<li>Total order requires that things are transitive and always have an answer when comparing two elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-streams-2"><a class="header" href="#future-streams-2">Future Streams</a></h3>

<h2 id="floating-point-operations-and-sorting-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-operations-and-sorting-mechanisms">Floating Point Operations and Sorting Mechanisms</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses floating point operations, the ord trait, and sorting mechanisms in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="floating-point-operations"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-operations">Floating Point Operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>NaN is used to express floating point operations that don’t have a well-defined answer.</li>
<li>Comparing a NaN to another floating point number is unclear how they’re related to one another.</li>
<li>f64 and f32 do not implement ord.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sorting-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#sorting-mechanisms">Sorting Mechanisms</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has implemented several sorting mechanisms for you.</li>
<li>The primary mechanism is sort which requires that the t is ored and sorts the slice in place.</li>
<li>Sort is stable, meaning if two elements are equal it won’t swap them while doing the sort.</li>
<li>Sort by allows you to sort a slice of elements by a custom comparison function or field of a struct.</li>
<li>Sort by key specifically sorts by a field or something like that where you just provide a function that maps from the type in the slice to some other type that is itself ord and then it sorts by that by whatever that function returns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-of-sorting-trait"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-sorting-trait">Implementation of Sorting Trait</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A sort trait will be defined, which will be implemented using different sorting mechanisms.</li>
<li>There are many sorting algorithms with different properties such as stability, memory usage, and average complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sorting-algorithms-1"><a class="header" href="#sorting-algorithms-1">Sorting Algorithms</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses sorting algorithms and their performance. They explain that while it is ideal to have an algorithm with good performance for all cases, in practice, this is not always possible.</p>
<h3 id="bubble-sort"><a class="header" href="#bubble-sort">Bubble Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bubble sort is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm.</li>
<li>The average performance of bubble sort is n^2.</li>
<li>The worst-case scenario for bubble sort can be very bad (n^2).</li>
<li>To implement bubble sort, we need to create a trait called <code>Sorter</code> that takes a mutable slice of type <code>T</code>, where <code>T</code> implements <code>Ord</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-sorting-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#other-sorting-algorithms">Other Sorting Algorithms</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some other sorting algorithms have a best-case scenario of n when the slice is already sorted.</li>
<li>In general, the best average performance we can get for sorting algorithms is n log n.</li>
<li>Implementing sorting algorithms for iterators can be challenging because you don’t know how many elements you will get.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-bubble-sort"><a class="header" href="#implementing-bubble-sort">Implementing Bubble Sort</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses implementing bubble sort in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-bubble-sort-1"><a class="header" href="#implementing-bubble-sort-1">Implementing Bubble Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker creates a unit struct called “bubble sort” and implements the sorter trait for it.</li>
<li>Bubble sort is implemented by walking through the slice and swapping any out-of-order elements until no more swaps are needed.</li>

<h2 id="bubble-sort-and-insertion-sort"><a class="header" href="#bubble-sort-and-insertion-sort">Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses two sorting algorithms: bubble sort and insertion sort. They explain how each algorithm works and provide code examples.</p>
<h3 id="bubble-sort-1"><a class="header" href="#bubble-sort-1">Bubble Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
<li>The implementation of bubble sort is straightforward, but it’s not very efficient on large lists.</li>
<li>Slice swap is used in bubble sort to avoid using a temporary variable when swapping elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="insertion-sort"><a class="header" href="#insertion-sort">Insertion Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts.</li>
<li>Elements from the unsorted part are taken one by one and inserted into their correct position in the sorted part.</li>
<li>Insertion sort can also be implemented as a method on slices using <code>sort_unstable_by_key</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threshold-for-sorting"><a class="header" href="#threshold-for-sorting">Threshold for Sorting</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses setting a threshold for sorting.</p>
<ul>
<li>A threshold can be set for determining which elements should be sorted.</li>
<li>Elements beyond the threshold are considered unsorted while those before it are already sorted.</li>
<li>This approach avoids unnecessary sorting of already sorted elements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="insertion-sort-1"><a class="header" href="#insertion-sort-1">Insertion Sort</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to implement insertion sort and compares it to bubble sort.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-insertion-sort"><a class="header" href="#implementing-insertion-sort">Implementing Insertion Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Take slice unsorted and place in sorted location in slice up to unsorted.</li>
<li>While i is greater than zero and slice i minus one is greater than i, keep shifting it left until it no longer needs to go left.</li>
<li>Keep swapping the current element to the left until the next element is smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comparison-with-bubble-sort"><a class="header" href="#comparison-with-bubble-sort">Comparison with Bubble Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Insertion sort does not walk the whole array like bubble sort does.</li>
<li>There are two ways of moving elements: walking from left to right or swapping from right.</li>
<li>Insertion sort works better with linked lists because you don’t need to shift all elements over.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-implementation"><a class="header" href="#alternative-implementation">Alternative Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An alternative way of moving elements is by mem copying all things from that position forward one over.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses using binary search and insert to sort a slice. They explain how binary search works and why it can be more efficient than other methods.</p>
<h3 id="binary-search-and-insert"><a class="header" href="#binary-search-and-insert">Binary Search and Insert</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Binary search can be used with insert to reduce the number of comparisons needed when sorting a slice.</li>
<li>To use binary search with insert, first call <code>slice.binary_search()</code> to find the index where the value should be inserted.</li>
<li><code>slice.binary_search()</code> returns either an index or an error if the slice is not sorted.</li>
<li>After finding the correct index, use <code>slice.insert()</code> to splice in the new value at that location.</li>
<li>Using <code>rotate_right()</code> instead of <code>insert()</code> can further optimize this process by shifting all elements over by one without resizing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-32"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-32">Conclusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>While using binary search and insert can improve efficiency, it still requires n-squared swaps. Using <code>rotate_right()</code> can further optimize this process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binary-search-and-sorting"><a class="header" href="#binary-search-and-sorting">Binary Search and Sorting</a></h2>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces selection sort and compares it to insertion sort.</p>
<h3 id="selection-sort"><a class="header" href="#selection-sort">Selection Sort</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Selection sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm that is generally worse than insertion sort.</li>
<li>Unlike insertion sort, selection sort can be done entirely in place without using any additional memory.</li>
<li>The idea behind selection sort is to find the smallest element of the list and stick it at the front, then find the smallest element in the remainder of the list and stick it at the front again until you’ve sorted the entire array.</li>
<li>The implementation of selection sort does not have any arguments and is always dumb.</li>
<li>A test for selection sort should be more comprehensive than just testing one particular case.</li>
</ul>

<li>The speaker explains that we can use the enumerate function on iterator to find the smallest element.</li>
<li>He demonstrates using dot enumerate dot min by key to find the smallest element in an iterator.</li>
<li>The speaker uses dot unwrap or expect since he knows that slice is non-empty.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker encounters a lifetime issue while trying to return a reference into slice.</li>
<li>He explains that min by key gives you a reference to each element, but v is also a reference itself into slice.</li>

<h2 id="quick-sort"><a class="header" href="#quick-sort">Quick Sort</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces quicksort, which is a more complex sorting mechanism than bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quicksort works by picking an element randomly from the list and then putting everything smaller than that element on one side and everything larger on the other side.</li>
<li>A helper method may be helpful for quicksort.</li>
<li>The pivot can be chosen randomly or based on research about how to choose a good pivot.</li>

<h3 id="quick-sort-algorithm-1"><a class="header" href="#quick-sort-algorithm-1">Quick Sort Algorithm</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The quick sort algorithm involves sorting a list by dividing it into two smaller sub-lists.</li>
<li>The algorithm is recursive in nature, with left and right sub-lists shrinking until they are only one element long.</li>
<li>At this point, the sub-list is already sorted.</li>
<li>To merge two lists, we need to allocate memory for both left and right lists which can be inefficient.</li>
<li>The speaker proposes implementing quick sort as an in-place sort instead of using separate vectors for left and right.</li>

<h3 id="picking-a-pivot"><a class="header" href="#picking-a-pivot">Picking a Pivot</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To implement quick sort as an in-place sort, we need to pick a pivot element from the slice.</li>
<li>We can use <code>split_at_mut</code> method to get mutable references to two sub-slices where one holds the pivot element while other holds rest of elements that needs sorting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="partitioning-elements"><a class="header" href="#partitioning-elements">Partitioning Elements</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We can partition elements based on their relation with pivot element i.e., less than or greater than pivot element.</li>

<h3 id="using-left-and-right-side-indicators"><a class="header" href="#using-left-and-right-side-indicators">Using Left and Right Side Indicators</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If slice of i is less than or equal to the pivot, it stays in place on the correct side.</li>
<li>We need left and right side indicators. If the next element is less than or equal to the pivot, it’s already on the left side. Otherwise, we move it to the right side.</li>
<li>After moving an element to the other side, we have to continue looking at this side. A for loop won’t work here because it would just move on to the next element.</li>
<li>Instead of using a for loop, we use a while loop that continuously looks at elements on the left and moves them if necessary.</li>
<li>We can do a slice swap of left with right. Then we do <code>right -= 1</code> since we need to look at this element again.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-walkthrough"><a class="header" href="#example-walkthrough">Example Walkthrough</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagine that we have a slice with a pivot somewhere. We have <code>left</code> pointing to everything before <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> pointing to everything after <code>right</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>slice[left]</code> is less than or equal to the pivot, it’s already in <code>left</code>. Otherwise, we move it over to <code>right</code>.</li>
<li>To move an element to the other side, we do a slice swap of left with right. Then we do <code>right -= 1</code> since we need to look at this element again.</li>
<li>The iterator code looks at the element at <code>left</code>. If that element is less than or equal to the pivot, it should be in <code>left</code>. Otherwise, it needs to go into <code>right</code>.</li>
<li>To move an element from <code>left</code> to <code>right</code>, we swap it with whatever element is over there and then decrement <code>right</code>.

<p>Section Overview: The speaker explains that subtyping and variance are niche topics that can be hard to understand. They
recommend reading through the Rust reference and Rust nomicon for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rust reference is not great for understanding subtyping and variance.</li>

<h2 id="implementing-stir-talk-function"><a class="header" href="#implementing-stir-talk-function">Implementing Stir Talk Function</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker will implement the stir talk function from C++ and NC, which takes a string and delimiter
as input, returns the string up to the next delimiter, then changes the original string by removing the prefix returned.</p>
<ul>
<li>This function is similar to strip prefix in the Rust standard library but uses a delimiter instead of a string.</li>
<li>The function mutates the string in place so it can be called repeatedly.</li>
<li>Implementing this function straightforwardly runs into issues with variance, making it difficult to use.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the concept of stir talk and explains its basic signature.
They also discuss how stir talk modifies a pointer to a string.</p>
<h3 id="basic-signature-of-stir-talk"><a class="header" href="#basic-signature-of-stir-talk">Basic Signature of Stir Talk</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Stir talk takes a string and a delimiter as input.</li>
<li>It takes a mutable reference to a string because it modifies the pointer to the string.</li>
<li>The function returns everything up to the delimiter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-usage-of-stir-talk"><a class="header" href="#example-usage-of-stir-talk">Example Usage of Stir Talk</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To use stir talk, pass in a mutable reference to a variable holding the string and delimiter.</li>
<li>The function will modify the pointer so that it points after the delimiter and return everything before it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-of-stir-talk"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-stir-talk">Implementation of Stir Talk</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The implementation is not complicated. Find the first occurrence of the delimiter in s using <code>find()</code>.</li>
<li>Split s at that location into prefix and suffix.</li>
<li>Set s to be suffix and return prefix.</li>
<li>If there is no occurrence of delimiter, set s to empty string, have prefix be entirety of s, and return prefix.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:17s"></a> The length of the delimiter is important when slicing strings.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:30s"></a> The function should work with UTF-8 strings as well since it finds the start of the delimiter and
slices the string up to that point.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:12:51s"></a> After finding the delimiter, we skip past it and return everything after it.</li>

<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:14:26s"></a> The issue arises because hello has the same lifetime as the mutable reference given in, so as long as

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:15:13s"></a> We add an extra scope around the code to drop hello so that the mutable reference to x should no longer
be in use.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:15:19s"></a> However, when running <code>cargo test</code>, it still fails with the same error message about borrowing mutable

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:16:27s"></a> We simplify the code by having <code>stir_talk</code> return a static string instead of a mutable one.</li>

<h2 id="understanding-static-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#understanding-static-borrowing">Understanding Static Borrowing</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how the compiler sees a static borrow and why it needs to be
static. They also explore how the compiler can shorten the lifetime of a mutable borrow.</p>
<h3 id="compilers-perspective-on-static-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#compilers-perspective-on-static-borrowing">Compiler’s Perspective on Static Borrowing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compiler sees a static borrow and assumes that tick a is static.</li>
<li>If tick a is static, then this must be static, and if that’s static, then this mutable borrow has to be a static
borrow.</li>
<li>This mutable borrow of x is only valid for the lifetime of x until drop. Therefore, it needs to last until the end of
the program. However, x is a stack variable so that won’t work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shortening-lifetime-of-mutable-borrow"><a class="header" href="#shortening-lifetime-of-mutable-borrow">Shortening Lifetime of Mutable Borrow</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The mutable borrow of x needs to be able to last until the end of the program but since x is not global or heap
allocated it cannot do so.</li>
<li>The compiler knows that if you have a static reference, you can use it in place of anything with shorter lifetime
reference.</li>
<li>If you have a string with a static lifetime, it’s valid in any context that takes non-static lifetime because the
static lifetime is always longer than any other lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploring-variance"><a class="header" href="#exploring-variance">Exploring Variance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The reason why we can provide tick-static-t instead of take-a-tick-t when taking t as an argument is due to variance
specifically covariance.</li>
<li>If we have two strings where one has a non-static lifetime and another has a static lifetime, we can still assign them
because any string with a static lifetime is valid in any context that takes non-static lifetime.</li>
<li>The compiler knows that it can shorten the borrow of x in some cases, but not in others. This is what we will explore
next.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-x-static"><a class="header" href="#making-x-static">Making X Static</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we don’t have an assertion, the compiler can pretend that the mutable borrow has the same lifetime as x until it’s
dropped.</li>
<li>When we add an assertion, this is now trying to immutably access x before x is dropped and won’t compile again because
x needs to be static.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-does-this-example-work"><a class="header" href="#why-does-this-example-work">Why Does This Example Work?</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why a specific example works in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="subtyping"><a class="header" href="#subtyping">Subtyping</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The type of <code>y</code> is some lifetime tick <code>a</code>, but we’re assigning something that is a tick static into something that’s a
ticket.</li>
<li>A subtype is when some type <code>t</code> is at least as useful as some type <code>u</code>.</li>
<li>Static is a subtype of any tick <code>a</code>.</li>
<li>You can use subtyping for things that aren’t lifetimes in Rust currently variants mostly just affects lifetimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variance"><a class="header" href="#variance">Variance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Most things are covariant.</li>
<li>If you have some function foo that takes a t and doesn’t return anything, you can use the same argument for if you
have some x of type t and you want to assign to it.</li>
<li>Here’s what we’re going to do: let’s say that foo takes a tick <code>a</code> stir. You’re allowed to provide any type that is a
subtype of the arguments in this case right so I can call foo with some tick <code>a</code> stir but I can also call foo with a
static stirrer static is a subtype of <code>a</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="covariance"><a class="header" href="#covariance">Covariance</a></h2>

<h3 id="not-every-type-is-covariant"><a class="header" href="#not-every-type-is-covariant">Not Every Type Is Covariant</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are three types of variance: covariance, contravariance, and invariance.</li>
<li>Animal is not a subtype of cat because cats can do things that animals can’t.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="covariance-and-contravariance"><a class="header" href="#covariance-and-contravariance">Covariance and Contravariance</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses covariance and contravariance in Rust, specifically in relation to functions
that take arguments of different types.</p>
<h3 id="covariant-types"><a class="header" href="#covariant-types">Covariant Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A type is covariant if it can be replaced with a subtype.</li>
<li>In Rust, most types are covariant.</li>
<li>Examples of covariant types include <code>&amp;'a T</code> and <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contravariant-types"><a class="header" href="#contravariant-types">Contravariant Types</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A type is contravariant if it can be replaced with a supertype.</li>
<li>In Rust, the only contravariant type is <code>fn(T)</code>.</li>
<li>An example of a contravariant function argument is a function that takes an argument of type <code>fn(&amp;'a str)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-function-arguments"><a class="header" href="#example-function-arguments">Example: Function Arguments</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If a function expects an argument of type <code>fn(&amp;'a str)</code> but receives an argument of type <code>fn(&amp;'static str)</code>, this will
not compile because the provided function requires a longer lifetime than what was expected.</li>
<li>However, if the function expects an argument of type <code>fn(&amp;'static str)</code> but receives an argument of
type <code>fn(&amp;'a str)</code>, this will compile because the provided function requires a shorter lifetime than what was
expected.</li>

<h3 id="covariance-and-contravariance-1"><a class="header" href="#covariance-and-contravariance-1">Covariance and Contravariance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:39:55"></a> Covariant types are more generally applicable than their subtypes.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:40:19"></a> In Rust, function argument types are the only place where we have contravariant types.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:41:03"></a> A static lifetime is a subtype of any other lifetime ticket.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:41:08"></a> A function with a tick a t argument is a subtype of a static t.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:41:28"></a> The subtyping relationship between these two types is flipped, which is what contravariance means.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="invariance"><a class="header" href="#invariance">Invariance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:41:57"></a> Invariance refers to cases where neither covariance nor contravariance applies.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:42:18"></a> Mutable references to a type T are covariant in the tick a but invariant in the T.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:42:42"></a> If mutable references were covariant, it would be possible to assign an x of type static string
reference into foo that takes mutable reference to some string pointer. However, this would lead to issues when trying
to print x since it’s pointing into stack local memory that has since been dropped.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/curst_of_rust/t=0:43.11"></a> The concept of cell static is introduced as an example for explaining why mutable references cannot be

</ul>
<p>Overall, this section provides an overview of how covariance and contravariance work in Rust lifetimes and explains why
there are cases where neither applies (invariance). It also introduces the concept of cell static as an example for
explaining why mutable references cannot be covariant.</p>
<h2 id="invariance-for-mutable-references"><a class="header" href="#invariance-for-mutable-references">Invariance for Mutable References</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains why mutable references are invariant in their argument type.</p>
<h3 id="why-mutable-references-are-invariant"><a class="header" href="#why-mutable-references-are-invariant">Why Mutable References are Invariant</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mutable references are invariant in their argument type.</li>
<li>Invariance means that you must provide something that is exactly the same as what was specified. You cannot provide
something more useful or less useful.</li>
<li>The compiler needs to reconcile the provided arguments with the signature of foo, but it cannot make static be equal
to take a or take a equal to static because mutable references are invariant in their thing that they reference.</li>
<li>If mutable references were not invariant, you could downgrade a mutable reference to something less useful and end up
with something that thinks it’s a more useful type but it’s actually a less useful type.</li>

<h3 id="covariance-and-invariance-for-immutable-references-1"><a class="header" href="#covariance-and-invariance-for-immutable-references-1">Covariance and Invariance for Immutable References</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Immutable reference to t is covariant in its lifetime but invariant in the t because if we had covariance, we could
have an immutable reference to b with some lifetime and then stick in something less useful.</li>
<li>The lifetime of the mutable reference to b is from b until when b gets dropped.</li>
<li>We can introduce a memory leak using box leak which allows us to get an immutable reference with any lifetime but
specifically with a static lifetime.</li>
<li>Here, z is a mutable reference to y and we set z equals x which compiles fine because immutable references are
covariant in their lifetime but invariant in the t.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker goes back to a previous example where there was an issue with lifetimes.</li>
<li>The compiler tells us that x does not live long enough because it needs to figure out how long the mutable borrow will

<p>Section Overview: The speaker introduces an additional lifetime to fix a code that previously did not compile.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new signature for <code>stir_talk</code> now has two lifetimes: one for mutable borrow and one for the string being pointed
to.</li>
<li>The compiler can now choose these two lifetimes independently, allowing us to choose one as static and one as
non-static.</li>
<li>With this new signature, the previously non-compiling code now compiles successfully.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rust assumes that any generic lifetime argument implies at least for as long as the duration of the function. This
assumption is all we need for our mutable reference.</li>
<li>Tick b does not depend on tick a; we are only returning a string.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="borrow-checker-rules"><a class="header" href="#borrow-checker-rules">Borrow Checker Rules</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the borrow checker rules in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-reference-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#mutable-reference-lifetime">Mutable Reference Lifetime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Modifying a variable after a mutable borrow would cause an error.</li>
<li>Non-lexical lifetimes (NLL) enabled in Rust 2015 edition, but before NLL, this code would not compile.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borrowing-rules-1"><a class="header" href="#borrowing-rules-1">Borrowing Rules</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can have a mutable reference to something that lives longer than the mutable reference.</li>
<li>You cannot have a tick <code>a</code> is longer than tick <code>b</code>.</li>
<li>The compiler implicitly adds a bound that tick <code>b</code> must be shorter than or equal to tick <code>a</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phantom-data-1"><a class="header" href="#phantom-data-1">Phantom Data</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Phantom data is used when you have a type that is generic over <code>T</code>, but doesn’t directly contain it.</li>
<li>A phantom data field is added to satisfy the Rust compiler’s requirement for using unused type parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-drop-check"><a class="header" href="#the-drop-check">The Drop Check</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the drop check in Rust and how it determines whether generic types might be
dropped as well.</p>
<h3 id="the-drop-check-1"><a class="header" href="#the-drop-check-1">The Drop Check</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a type is dropped, Rust needs to know whether the generic types might be dropped as well.</li>
<li>If a vector of <code>T</code>s is dropped, then when you drop the vector, you’re also going to drop some <code>T</code>s.</li>
<li>Rust needs to know this because dropping a reference that still exists is not okay if it’s going to try to access the
reference later on.</li>
<li>However, if the vector is never accessed again after being dropped, then dropping the reference does not access the
inner type on drop and is okay.</li>
<li>The compiler knows this through something called the drop check which looks at whether the type contains a <code>T</code> and a
phantom data <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>Vec will only drop inner types if they implement drop themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="touch-drop"><a class="header" href="#touch-drop">Touch Drop</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses touch drops in Rust and how they relate to variance.</p>
<h3 id="touch-drop-1"><a class="header" href="#touch-drop-1">Touch Drop</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Touch drops are used for debugging purposes in Rust.</li>
<li>They require that their type is format debug and we’re going to impl drop for touch drop.</li>
<li>If you make this a touch drop instead of just a reference, then this code no longer compiles because when z gets
dropped right down here, we’re going to call this implementation of touch drop which is going to access the inner type
which means it’s going to access this reference so dropping x here is not okay because by when z gets dropped it’s
going to try to access the reference but when we drop the vector dropping the reference does not access the inner type
on drop.</li>
<li>Dropping x here would cause an error because there’s still a reference that lives down here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-phantom-data"><a class="header" href="#understanding-phantom-data">Understanding Phantom Data</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about phantom data and its use in Rust programming. They explain
how it is used to communicate ownership and drop semantics.</p>
<h3 id="phantom-data-2"><a class="header" href="#phantom-data-2">Phantom Data</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>self.0</code> is a tuple struct with one element.</li>
<li>The compiler assumes that it’s going to drop a <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>Phantom data <code>T</code> communicates that you are owning a <code>T</code> and might drop one.</li>
<li>Phantom data <code>Fnt</code> is a marker of contravariance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="invariance-1"><a class="header" href="#invariance-1">Invariance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want your type to be invariant in <code>T</code>, you can use phantom data.</li>
<li>The compiler concludes that the <code>T</code> in d serializer four must be invariant in T.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="covariance-1"><a class="header" href="#covariance-1">Covariance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Star const T is covariant.</li>
<li>Unsafe cell has to be invariant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raw-pointers-vs-phantom-data"><a class="header" href="#raw-pointers-vs-phantom-data">Raw Pointers vs. Phantom Data</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker compares raw pointers and phantom data, explaining why people prefer
using phantom data over raw pointers.</p>
<h3 id="raw-pointers"><a class="header" href="#raw-pointers">Raw Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Once you introduce raw pointers, there are a couple of things you don’t get like send and sync auto-implemented for
your types assuming all the members are.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="auto-implementation"><a class="header" href="#auto-implementation">Auto Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>People prefer using phantom data over raw pointers because if you use this type and a phantom data, it would get
auto-implemented for send and sync.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="covariance-and-invariance-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#covariance-and-invariance-in-rust">Covariance and Invariance in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section discusses the importance of understanding covariance and invariance in Rust, particularly
when dealing with generic types.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-covariance-and-invariance"><a class="header" href="#understanding-covariance-and-invariance">Understanding Covariance and Invariance</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It is important to consider whether a type is covariant or invariant when working with generic types.</li>
<li>If a compiler concludes that a type is invariant over T, but you need it to be covariant, you must ensure that your
code is not vulnerable to an “invariance attack.”</li>
<li>In unsafe code, if the safety of your code relies on a generic parameter being invariant but the compiler concludes
it’s covariant, you must ensure that your type is actually invariant.</li>
<li>In order to mutate through a pointer, you can only use <code>&amp;mut T</code>, <code>*mut T</code>, or <code>UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code>. All of these are
invariant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="syntax-for-lifetime-bounds"><a class="header" href="#syntax-for-lifetime-bounds">Syntax for Lifetime Bounds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The syntax <code>for&lt;'a&gt;</code> specifies that a bound holds for any lifetime <code>'a'</code>.</li>
<li>This syntax does not affect variance or subtyping.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mutating-through-star-const-t"><a class="header" href="#mutating-through-star-const-t">Mutating Through Star Const T</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You can technically mutate through <code>*const T</code> by casting it without undefined behavior. However, this should be
avoided as it requires contorting yourself into using an immutable reference as a mutable one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unique-types-and-non-null-pointers"><a class="header" href="#unique-types-and-non-null-pointers">Unique Types and Non-null Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Vectored types and box types contain unique pointers which are non-null. The nominal pointer type is covariant over T.</li>
<li>If this covariance is incorrect for your use case, include phantom data in your type to provide invariants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-lifetimes-variance-and-subtyping"><a class="header" href="#rust-lifetimes-variance-and-subtyping">Rust Lifetimes: Variance and Subtyping</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this video, the speaker covers variance and subtyping in Rust lifetimes. They start with a simple
function and show how adding lifetimes can cause issues. The speaker then explains how to fix these issues using
variance and subtyping.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-lifetime-specifiers"><a class="header" href="#understanding-lifetime-specifiers">Understanding Lifetime Specifiers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A simple function like <code>stir_talk</code> can become complicated when lifetime specifiers are added.</li>
<li>Adding lifetime specifiers to every reference is not enough to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Using tick marks (<code>'a</code>) on all references can lead to problems that are difficult to diagnose.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solving-lifetime-issues-with-variance-and-subtyping"><a class="header" href="#solving-lifetime-issues-with-variance-and-subtyping">Solving Lifetime Issues with Variance and Subtyping</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding a second lifetime specifier solves the issue of calling <code>stir_talk</code>.</li>
<li>The solution involves using variance and subtyping.</li>
<li>By the end of the video, viewers should have a better understanding of variance and subtyping in Rust lifetimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-explicit-code"><a class="header" href="#writing-explicit-code">Writing Explicit Code</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s possible to write code without explicit lifetime specifiers by relying on Rust’s automatic generation of unique
lifetimes for each reference.</li>
<li>However, it’s recommended to be explicit about different lifetimes for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-33"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-33">Conclusion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker thanks viewers for joining them in this journey through Rust lifetimes.</li>
<li>They acknowledge that explaining type inference can be challenging but hope that viewers landed in a good place.</li>
<li>The next stream will likely involve live coding, possibly porting some code.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-21"><a class="header" href="#introduction-21">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the topic of the stream, which is implementing hazard pointers
in Rust. The speaker also mentions that they will be focusing on testing and recaps some information from previous
streams.</p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker welcomes viewers to another implementation stream where they will be working on implementing hazard
pointers in Rust.</li>
<li>They mention that they are porting a library called Folly from Facebook and specifically focusing on the hazard
pointer scheme.</li>
<li>The speaker notes that today’s focus will primarily be on testing and ensuring that the implementation works as
intended.</li>
<li>They briefly mention their book “Rust for Rustations” and provide information about where it can be purchased.</li>
<li>Lastly, they touch upon some changes since the previous stream, including merging a pull request and an issue with
panic in has pointer domain drop when using local domains.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-since-last-stream"><a class="header" href="#changes-since-last-stream">Changes Since Last Stream</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses changes made since the last stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>A viewer submitted a pull request that simplified a macro used to work around limitations of the borrow checker.</li>
<li>An issue was filed regarding a panic in has pointer domain drop when using local domains. The speaker plans to write a
test to reproduce this problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synchronization-primitives"><a class="header" href="#synchronization-primitives">Synchronization Primitives</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the synchronization primitives, including hazard pointers.</p>
<h3 id="hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#hazard-pointers">Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A commit aligns the Facebook implementation with the standards proposal for the CPA simplest working group.</li>
<li>The library exports an atomic pointer type and a hazard pointer object wrapper type.</li>
<li>Hazard pointers guard pointer values, so a holder is required to protect them.</li>
<li>The global domain keeps track of all of the slots that have been given out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protecting-pointer-values"><a class="header" href="#protecting-pointer-values">Protecting Pointer Values</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To protect a pointer value, you atomically load it and store it in your slot.</li>
<li>You get back a reference that you can use to access the underlying values.</li>
<li>The reference must remain valid at all times for as long as it lives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="releasing-pointer-values"><a class="header" href="#releasing-pointer-values">Releasing Pointer Values</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dropping the holder releases your guarding of the value, and you can no longer use the reference that you got back
from protect.</li>
<li>On the writer’s side, allocate some new replacement value and call swap.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hazard-pointers-1"><a class="header" href="#hazard-pointers-1">Hazard Pointers</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section explains how hazard pointers work and how they ensure that objects are not prematurely
freed.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-pointer-values-with-hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#protecting-pointer-values-with-hazard-pointers">Protecting Pointer Values with Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a pointer value is swapped, the old value is still accessible because it has not been dropped or freed.</li>
<li>Hazard pointers guard the value to ensure it is not prematurely freed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retiring-pointer-values"><a class="header" href="#retiring-pointer-values">Retiring Pointer Values</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Retiring a pointer value means telling the hazard pointer library that it can be safely freed.</li>
<li>A data structure may have multiple pointers to a given pointer value, so multiple atomic operations may need to be
performed before it is safe to free the object.</li>
<li>The writer tells the hazard pointer library when a value should be retired and how to drop it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="live-vs-retired-objects"><a class="header" href="#live-vs-retired-objects">Live vs. Retired Objects</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A live object is reachable and has not been retired, while a retired object is no longer reachable by new readers but
may still be accessed by old readers.</li>
<li>A reclaimable object can be dropped and its memory reclaimed because there are no hazard pointers guarding it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-of-using-hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#example-of-using-hazard-pointers">Example of Using Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An example demonstrates how an old pointer becomes retired after being swapped and then notified as retired. It
becomes reclaimable only after all hazard pointers guarding it have been dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-pointer-type"><a class="header" href="#atomic-pointer-type">Atomic Pointer Type</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker discusses the implementation of an atomic pointer type that internally uses a box,
simplifying safety and variance. They also discuss how this low-level interface can be used to build nicer abstractions
on top of it.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-atomic-pointer-type"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-atomic-pointer-type">Implementation of Atomic Pointer Type</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An atomic pointer type is implemented using a box.</li>
<li>This simplifies safety and variance.</li>
<li>The retire method still needs to be unsafe because the outer data structure’s construction is unknown.</li>
<li>Protect requires a valid pointer value, which can always be guaranteed if the pointer value is provided.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-made-for-hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#changes-made-for-hazard-pointers">Changes Made for Hazard Pointers</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker discusses changes made for hazard pointers, including renaming get protected to protect
and reset to reset protection.</p>
<h3 id="changes-made-for-hazard-pointers-1"><a class="header" href="#changes-made-for-hazard-pointers-1">Changes Made for Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Folly renamed get protected to protect and reset to reset protection.</li>
<li>Reset protection was added in holder as a change we can make easily.</li>
<li>Renaming makes it clear that you are resetting the protection rather than resetting the pointer or its protection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tidying-up-interface-names"><a class="header" href="#tidying-up-interface-names">Tidying Up Interface Names</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: The speaker talks about how keeping names similar between implementations will make following diffs
simpler. They also discuss whether they should apply all changes or start with testing first.</p>
<h3 id="tidying-up-interface-names-1"><a class="header" href="#tidying-up-interface-names-1">Tidying Up Interface Names</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using similar names between implementations will make following diffs simpler.</li>
<li>Helper methods like check cleanup and reclaim match exactly what was in the folly code base.</li>
<li>It’s tempting to do testing first before applying changes but there’s a question of whether they want to go through
these and apply all changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-hazard-pointer-holders"><a class="header" href="#understanding-hazard-pointer-holders">Understanding Hazard Pointer Holders</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the changes made to the constructor for hazard pointer holders
and how they are used.</p>
<h3 id="constructor-changes"><a class="header" href="#constructor-changes">Constructor Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The default constructors now construct empty holders and arrays.</li>
<li>The default constructor should not acquire a hazard pointer from the domain.</li>
<li>A free function is provided for constructing a non-empty holder using make hazard pointer.</li>
<li>The change makes it more annoying to construct a holder without an associated hazard pointer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hazard-pointer-holders"><a class="header" href="#hazard-pointer-holders">Hazard Pointer Holders</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Holders do not have a slot but hold a hazard pointer that has the slot.</li>
<li>Acquire a protection slot from the domain and put it in the holder.</li>
<li>The default constructor gives you a holder with no associated hazard pointer yet.</li>
<li>Make hazard pointer can be called without providing a domain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hazard-pointer-holder"><a class="header" href="#hazard-pointer-holder">Hazard Pointer Holder</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the hazard pointer holder and its association with the lifetime
of a domain. They also discuss implementing default for hazard pointer holder specifically for static.</p>
<h3 id="default-implementation-for-hazard-pointer-holder"><a class="header" href="#default-implementation-for-hazard-pointer-holder">Default Implementation for Hazard Pointer Holder</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The hazard pointer holder is tied to the lifetime of the domain that you constructed with.</li>
<li>It’s not entirely clear what would happen if you don’t specify a domain.</li>
<li>One option is to implement default for hazard pointer holder specifically for static.</li>
<li>It’s unclear what we would even default this to, but we could implement it for unit.</li>
<li>This would produce a hazard pointer holder that is either empty or acquired.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-variants-and-enums"><a class="header" href="#private-variants-and-enums">Private Variants and Enums</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The variants should be private, but in Rust, you can’t mark variants as private.</li>
<li>To make them non-public, they will become an enum called “hazardpointerholderinnerdomainf”.</li>
<li>This will be an empty enum.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-hazard-pointer"><a class="header" href="#make-hazard-pointer">Make Hazard Pointer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Make Hazard Pointer” is what they call the method used to create a hazard pointer explicitly.</li>
<li>The method takes a domain and returns a hazard pointer holder for that domain and given f.</li>
<li>This method is generic over f2 and returns self of hazard pointer holder inner acquired.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructor"><a class="header" href="#constructor">Constructor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>They have a constructor which was equal to the default hazard pointer domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss proposed changes to the Hazard Pointer Holder API.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-changes"><a class="header" href="#proposed-changes">Proposed Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no constructor for retroactively setting a hazard pointer for a given domain.</li>
<li>The example does not show how to construct from a given domain or holder.</li>
<li>It is not clear why the proposed API is superior and it may not be worth implementing.</li>
<li>They discuss what happens when try protect is called without an HP rec.</li>
<li>They mention that source.load doesn’t work in this context.</li>
<li>An empty object is needed for moves to leave behind.</li>
<li>They discuss when constructing a default value might be useful in Rust land.</li>
<li>Wrapping it in an option would suffice instead of re-implementing internally in the library.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-proposed-changes"><a class="header" href="#other-proposed-changes">Other Proposed Changes</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speakers discuss other proposed changes to the Hazard Pointer Holder API.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-changes-1"><a class="header" href="#proposed-changes-1">Proposed Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove unused hazard pointer domain data members unprotected and children and function reclaim unprotected safe.</li>
<li>Improve readability by specializing friends and using specialized aliases while reducing use of atom template
parameter.</li>
<li>Support class and function names consistent with wg2 by renaming hazard pointer holder to hazard pointer.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=0:44:41s"></a> The speaker starts by changing “has pointer holder” to “hazard pointer”.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=0:45:11s"></a> The speaker notes that “has pointer” is not a type in C++ and changes it to “has pointer wreck”.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=0:46:13s"></a> The speaker moves “pointer to record” and changes it from pub to record.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="qualification-and-importing"><a class="header" href="#qualification-and-importing">Qualification and Importing</a></h3>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Hazard pointers are a technique used in concurrent programming to manage memory reclamation.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=0:20s"></a>They were introduced by Maged Michael in 2004 as an alternative to garbage collection.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=0:40s"></a>The basic idea behind hazard pointers is that each thread maintains a list of “hazardous” pointers that it
is currently using.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=1:00s"></a>This allows other threads to safely reclaim memory without accidentally freeing memory that is still being

</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#implementing-hazard-pointers">Implementing Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=1:30s"></a>To implement hazard pointers, we need to keep track of two things: the set of hazardous pointers and the
set of retired objects.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=2:00s"></a>When a thread wants to access a pointer, it first checks if the pointer is already marked as hazardous. If
not, it marks the pointer as hazardous and proceeds with its operation.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=2:30s"></a>If a thread wants to retire an object, it adds the object to the retired set and then checks if any other
threads have marked any of its hazardous pointers. If so, it cannot free the object yet because another thread may
still be using it.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=3:00s"></a>Instead, it waits until all threads have removed their hazardous markers from the object before freeing it.</li>

<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=4:00s"></a>We can use crossbeam’s <code>epoch</code> module to create an epoch-based memory reclamation scheme.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=4:30s"></a>The <code>epoch</code> module provides a <code>Guard</code> struct that represents an epoch, which is a period of time during
which all hazardous pointers are guaranteed to be valid.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=5:00s"></a>We can use the <code>Guard</code> struct to safely access hazardous pointers and retire objects without worrying about

<h2 id="understanding-garbage-collection-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#understanding-garbage-collection-in-rust">Understanding Garbage Collection in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this transcript, the speaker discusses garbage collection in Rust and how it works. They go through
the code step by step to explain how the garbage collector identifies and reclaims unused memory.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-unused-memory"><a class="header" href="#identifying-unused-memory">Identifying Unused Memory</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The garbage collector starts by identifying all nodes that are not being used.</li>
<li>Nodes that are still being used are marked as “guarded”.</li>
<li>The garbage collector then goes through each node and determines if it can be reclaimed or not.</li>
<li>Reclaimable nodes are added to a list for later processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reclaiming-unused-memory"><a class="header" href="#reclaiming-unused-memory">Reclaiming Unused Memory</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Once all reclaimable nodes have been identified, they are processed one at a time.</li>
<li>The garbage collector checks if any other nodes reference the current node being processed. If so, it cannot be
reclaimed yet.</li>
<li>If no other nodes reference the current node, it is marked as “reclaimed” and its memory is freed up for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="separating-identification-from-reclamation"><a class="header" href="#separating-identification-from-reclamation">Separating Identification from Reclamation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The process of identifying unused memory is separated from actually reclaiming it. This allows for more efficient
processing of large amounts of data.</li>
<li>Unreclaimable nodes are pushed back onto the untagged list for later processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="helper-methods"><a class="header" href="#helper-methods">Helper Methods</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A helper method called <code>is_empty</code> is created to check if a linked list is empty or not.</li>
<li>Another helper method called <code>push</code> takes a sublist tail and inserts it into a linked list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-36"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-36">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>The speaker provides an in-depth explanation of how garbage collection works in Rust, including the identification and
reclamation of unused memory. They also discuss the importance of separating the identification process from the
reclamation process for more efficient processing. Helper methods are created to aid in these processes.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=2:38:03s"></a> The speaker describes a neat loop where children are grabbed and then reclaimed unconditional head is
called.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/implementing_hazard_pointers_in_rust/t=2:38:15s"></a> The speaker assumes that reclaim unconditional head walks all things from head to tail, pushing any
children it finds into children.</li>

<ul>
<li>The word “man” can remain unsafe.</li>
<li>“Reclaim unprotected” is equivalent to “reclaim all objects,” but differs in name to clarify that it will remove
indiscriminately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="naming-error"><a class="header" href="#naming-error">Naming Error</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about a naming error in the function “reclaim unprotected.”</p>
<h3 id="naming-error-in-reclaim-unprotected"><a class="header" href="#naming-error-in-reclaim-unprotected">Naming Error in Reclaim Unprotected</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The function name “reclaim unprotected” is a naming error because it implies that only unprotected objects are being
reclaimed.</li>
<li>The function actually reclaims all objects unconditionally, and it’s up to the caller to check whether they’re
protected or not.</li>
<li>Despite the naming error, the speaker wants to keep the name for easier refactorings later with respect to the
upstream code base.</li>

<ul>
<li>Shut down doesn’t need to be an atomic bool; it can just be a bool.</li>
<li>The other thing they call is free hazard pointer rex.</li>
<li>Fn free has pointer rex itself is probably already right because it’s really just walking the list of hazard pointers.</li>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about a shared reference issue.</p>
<h3 id="exclusive-and-shared-references"><a class="header" href="#exclusive-and-shared-references">Exclusive and Shared References</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The existence of an exclusive reference implies that a shared reference shouldn’t exist.</li>
<li>Statics are never dropped, which means that we don’t actually need to deal with the global domain being dropped
because it never gets dropped and that’s why there’s no unsafety there.</li>
<li>In that case, the drop here is kind of stupid because this can just never happen.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker questions the need for a check on the global domain.</li>
<li>Asserting that the global domain can be dropped implies something false, so it’s not useful to think about it.</li>
<li>Static items do not call drop at the end of the program, so there is no need to check if they are active.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debug-check-for-hazard-pointers"><a class="header" href="#debug-check-for-hazard-pointers">Debug Check for Hazard Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>

<h2 id="introduction-23"><a class="header" href="#introduction-23">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces a set of distributed systems challenges that use a platform
called Maelstrom. The challenges are designed to build an increasingly sophisticated distributed system and run it
through Maelstrom to test its correctness.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-systems-challenges"><a class="header" href="#distributed-systems-challenges">Distributed Systems Challenges</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The challenges use a platform called Maelstrom, which is a distributed systems testing framework.</li>
<li>The challenges involve building an increasingly sophisticated distributed system and running it through Maelstrom to
test its correctness.</li>
<li>The exercises are written in Go, but demo implementations of the node code are available in Ruby, JavaScript, Java,
and Python.</li>
<li>The speaker will be implementing the challenges in Rust since there isn’t a demo implementation available for Rust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker provides more information about Maelstrom and how it works.</p>
<h3 id="about-maelstrom"><a class="header" href="#about-maelstrom">About Maelstrom</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Maelstrom is a distributed systems testing framework or exercise framework.</li>
<li>It can orchestrate message passing between nodes in a distributed system and emulate things like delayed messages or
reordered messages or drop messages nodes coming and going that kind of stuff.</li>
<li>It’s written by or alongside the author of Jepson, which is doing correctness research for distributed systems.</li>
<li>Jepson has found bugs in real systems like Redis, Raft, Postgres, etcd by studying real systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-the-protocol"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-protocol">Implementing the Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how they will implement the protocol required by Maelstrom.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-implementation"><a class="header" href="#protocol-implementation">Protocol Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each node is just a binary that receives JSON messages from standard input and sends JSON messages to standard output.</li>
<li>Messages have three parts: source (identifying string of sender), destination (identifying string of receiver), body (
message content).</li>
<li>Message bodies have reserved keys, and additional keys can be set depending on the message type.</li>
<li>The speaker will need to implement this protocol in Rust to get everything set up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-project"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-project">Setting up the Project</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker sets up the project and decides on a name for it.</p>

<h3 id="struct-definition"><a class="header" href="#struct-definition">Struct Definition</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The message struct has fields for source, destination (renamed to “dust”), type (renamed to “ty”), message ID, in
reply to, and body.</li>
<li>Body is either a string or a hashmap of string keys and serde_json values.</li>
<li>The speaker considers making body an enum tagged by type but ultimately decides against it.</li>
<li>Timestamp:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enum-and-payload"><a class="header" href="#enum-and-payload">Enum and Payload</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to use enums and payloads in Rust.</p>

<ul>
<li>The speaker models the state machine with a struct called Echo Node.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="echo-node-step-function"><a class="header" href="#echo-node-step-function">Echo Node Step Function</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the step function for an echo node in a distributed system.
They talk about the input message and how it returns a mutable reference to the state of the node.</p>
<h3 id="echo-node-step-function-1"><a class="header" href="#echo-node-step-function-1">Echo Node Step Function</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The step function gets a mutable reference to the state of the node in the distributed system and the input message.</li>
<li>A stream serializer is used to send messages as well as trigger messages to other nodes.</li>
<li>The step function needs a way to wait for a message before replying to the current message.</li>
<li>The reply is going to be a message with source, destination, body, and ID of response generated by self.id.</li>
<li>If we receive an echo, we do nothing. If we get an echo, that’s when we want to send the second reply.</li>
<li>We construct an output channel using Certi Jason serializer new standard out.</li>

<li>They mention that there are two types of messages: init and echo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="responding-to-init-message"><a class="header" href="#responding-to-init-message">Responding to Init Message</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about how nodes should respond to an init message.</p>
<h3 id="node-id-and-node-ids-fields"><a class="header" href="#node-id-and-node-ids-fields">Node ID and Node IDs Fields</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The node ID field indicates the ID of the node which is receiving this message.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="responding-with-required-message"><a class="header" href="#responding-with-required-message">Responding with Required Message</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For init, we don’t actually care about any of the fields but what we’re going to do is respond with the required
message which is here in it okay.</li>
<li>If we receive an edit okay message that should never happen we might receive an echo okay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flushing-standard-out"><a class="header" href="#flushing-standard-out">Flushing Standard Out</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker explains that the problem is that standard out is buffered so when we write out here we’re not flushing
standard out as well which means that the message isn’t actually getting out to the server.</li>
<li>It might be enough to just print a new line because this is a line buffered writer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="printing-new-line"><a class="header" href="#printing-new-line">Printing New Line</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about printing a new line.</p>
<h3 id="pretty-formatter"><a class="header" href="#pretty-formatter">Pretty Formatter</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The speaker suggests using pretty formatter to print a new line.</li>
<li>The protocol itself also requires that you print a new line because it’s newline separate adjacent objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inner-part-of-output-stream"><a class="header" href="#inner-part-of-output-stream">Inner Part of Output Stream</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to print a new line, we need to get at the inner part of this output stream which serializer doesn’t let us
do.</li>
<li>We can unwrap it and then put it back together but that feels unfortunate to have to do that but it might just be what
we have to do here.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=0:36:49s"></a> The speaker explains that the code requires encoding a line as JSON and mentions that it needs to be
one per line.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=0:37:20s"></a> The speaker suggests not constructing the serializer here and instead using standard out. They mention
using <code>reply.serialize</code> and <code>serde_json::to_writer</code>.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=0:37:49s"></a> The speaker uses <code>output.write_all</code> to write all of the output.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=0.40.03s"></a> A question is asked about whether or not step functions can return messages, but the answer is no
because there may be multiple messages sent or received at once.</li>
<li><a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=0.41.04s"></a> The speaker confirms that returning messages is possible for convenience, but it’s separate from the
mechanism of sending messages.</li>

it scales better than broadcast.</p>
<h3 id="broadcast-vs-gossip"><a class="header" href="#broadcast-vs-gossip">Broadcast vs. Gossip</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast sends a message to every node in the system, which doesn’t scale well.</li>
<li>Gossip sends a message to nodes in its topology or neighborhood, defined by direct network links or other criteria.</li>
<li>Topologies do not have to be symmetrical; nodes can have different neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Values should propagate to all other nodes within a few seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-gossip-works"><a class="header" href="#how-gossip-works">How Gossip Works</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a node receives a message through gossip, it sends it to everyone in its topology except for the sender.</li>
<li>The receiving nodes then send the message to their topologies until every node has received it.</li>
<li>As long as there is at least one link from one node to another through transitive closures, any set of topologies will
eventually propagate messages to every node.</li>
<li>Scheduled gossip can be used instead of immediate gossip for scalability.</li>

forwarding. The speaker also discusses the issue of syncing data between nodes in a minimal fashion.</p>
<h3 id="how-gossip-protocol-works"><a class="header" href="#how-gossip-protocol-works">How Gossip Protocol Works</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Gossip protocol exchanges information with neighbors about data that one has but the other does not.</li>
<li>There is no blind forwarding in gossip protocol, which means there are no loops where messages keep getting sent back
and forth between nodes.</li>
<li>When a node receives a new message, it contacts its neighbors to compare notes and sync up their data sets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="syncing-data-between-nodes"><a class="header" href="#syncing-data-between-nodes">Syncing Data Between Nodes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Syncing data between nodes can be problematic because sending an entire data set on every message is not practical.</li>
<li>To minimize the amount of data being sent during syncing, nodes can eliminate messages that they already have or know
about.</li>
<li>Nodes need to remember which messages they have synced with other nodes in the past to avoid sending unnecessary
messages during future syncs.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="optimizing-gossip-protocol"><a class="header" href="#optimizing-gossip-protocol">Optimizing Gossip Protocol</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We want it to be the case that if messages aren’t dropped then we’re able to eliminate messages from the sync.</li>
<li>It’s okay for us to send some extra values if some messages happen to be dropped as long as the recipient has a way to
detect that it already knows something.</li>
<li>All the messages in the system have unique IDs which makes it possible for us to keep a set and add new values when we
hear things from a neighbor.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="main-loop"><a class="header" href="#main-loop">Main Loop</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to generate additional input events in the main loop.</p>
<h3 id="generating-additional-input-events"><a class="header" href="#generating-additional-input-events">Generating Additional Input Events</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To generate additional input events, we need to give away the TX handle to the node.</li>
<li>We can construct this handle first and then initialize it with the node.</li>
<li>We can spawn a thread that generates messages or events on a time schedule.</li>
<li>This will surface in the main read loop when we call <code>node.step</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="event-payload"><a class="header" href="#event-payload">Event Payload</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to differentiate between injected payloads and actual
messages from the network.</p>
<h3 id="differentiating-between-injected-payloads-and-actual-messages"><a class="header" href="#differentiating-between-injected-payloads-and-actual-messages">Differentiating Between Injected Payloads and Actual Messages</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We want to differentiate between injected payloads and actual messages from the network.</li>
<li>We can use an enum called “event” with three options: message payload, body, or direct payload.</li>
<li>We need to serialize/deserialize these events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="echo-fix"><a class="header" href="#echo-fix">Echo Fix</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker fixes Echo so that it differentiates between injected events and actual
messages.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-echo"><a class="header" href="#fixing-echo">Fixing Echo</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Echo needs to differentiate between injected events and actual messages.</li>
<li>We can use an event payload input to differentiate between the two.</li>
<li>If there is an injected event when there should not be, we will panic.</li>
<li>The transmit handle in broadcast will never exit because it is held by the broadcast node.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-of-file-and-injected-payloads"><a class="header" href="#end-of-file-and-injected-payloads">End of File and Injected Payloads</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how to handle end-of-file events and injected payloads in a
node.</p>
<h3 id="handling-end-of-file-events"><a class="header" href="#handling-end-of-file-events">Handling End-of-File Events</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The end of file is reached.</li>
<li>The result of reaching the end of file is not important.</li>
<li>A way for the node to learn that it should exit is now available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handling-injected-payloads"><a class="header" href="#handling-injected-payloads">Handling Injected Payloads</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Inject” refers to a message being sent to a node from outside its network.</li>
<li>If the input is a message, do what was done previously.</li>
<li>If the input is an injected payload or end-of-file event, do something different.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to use different enums for injected events and messages in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="starting-a-new-thread"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-new-thread">Starting a New Thread</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A new thread will be started when constructing from init.</li>
<li>This thread will generate gossip events using a loop that sleeps for 300 milliseconds before sending an injected
gossip event.</li>
<li>An atomic bool can be used to terminate this loop when the node receives an end-of-file event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serialized-payload"><a class="header" href="#serialized-payload">Serialized Payload</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using variants for payloads means they must be serialized and deserialized even if it’s unnecessary.</li>
<li>Injected payloads should be separate from other payloads so that they don’t need to be matched on unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enum-for-injected-payload"><a class="header" href="#enum-for-injected-payload">Enum for Injected Payload</a></h3>
<p>-[]( t = 9289 s ) An enum called “injected payload” will have a default value of the unit type.
-[]( t = 9371 s ) Injected payloads need to be sent and they need to be static.
-[]( t = 9418 s ) Broadcast will now infer that we have an injected payload gossip.</p>

<li>They explain that they should be able to hear a match on payload and that the only injected payload is
Gossip. <a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=2m37s"></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-helper-functions"><a class="header" href="#creating-helper-functions">Creating Helper Functions</a></h3>

right. <a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=2m38s"></a></li>
<li>They also create another helper function called “serialized_response_message” which is used for serialization of
response messages. <a href="rust_video_summary/impl_rust/t=2m40s"></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="updating-gossip-protocol"><a class="header" href="#updating-gossip-protocol">Updating Gossip Protocol</a></h3>

<h2 id="gossip-protocol-implementation"><a class="header" href="#gossip-protocol-implementation">Gossip Protocol Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to implement a gossip protocol. They discuss sending
messages and gossiping between nodes.</p>
<h3 id="sending-messages"><a class="header" href="#sending-messages">Sending Messages</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All messages will be sent to everyone in the neighborhood during gossip time.</li>
<li>When someone tells us about a message, we add it to the set that we have.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gossiping-between-nodes"><a class="header" href="#gossiping-between-nodes">Gossiping Between Nodes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>During gossip scene, we extend the scene and do not reply.</li>
<li>The nodes start gossiping with each other, descending to random other nodes in the network.</li>
<li>As messages become longer, it takes longer for any given message to propagate across the network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naive-gossip-implementation"><a class="header" href="#naive-gossip-implementation">Naive Gossip Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When receiving a gossip message, we know that the sender knows about all of the messages they sent us.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="performance-analysis"><a class="header" href="#performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker analyzes performance issues related to implementing a gossip protocol.</p>
<h3 id="broadcast-rate-vs-propagation-delay"><a class="header" href="#broadcast-rate-vs-propagation-delay">Broadcast Rate vs. Propagation Delay</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The broadcast rate is not what we want because it only measures how fast broadcast operations succeed.</li>
<li>Longer gossip messages mean slower propagation between new nodes and longer delays for any given message to propagate
across the network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visibility-delay"><a class="header" href="#visibility-delay">Visibility Delay</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We want visibility delay which shows delay between when a message is broadcast and when it’s visible to all peers.</li>
<li>The delay doesn’t seem to surface in the current view.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naive-gossip-implementation-1"><a class="header" href="#naive-gossip-implementation-1">Naive Gossip Implementation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast won’t get slower with naive gossip implementation because it doesn’t trigger any work.</li>
<li>The speaker concludes that naive gossip implementation is not good enough and proposes a better solution.
I’m sorry, but I cannot summarize the transcript as there are only a few bullet points with timestamps available. The

<h3 id="generics"><a class="header" href="#generics">Generics</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Generics allow for code reuse by creating functions that can work with multiple data types.</li>
<li>Using generics can impact performance as it requires the compiler to do more work and may result in a larger binary.</li>
<li>Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in concrete types used at
compile time.</li>
<li>The compiler outputs specific code for each data type used with a generic function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="traits-1"><a class="header" href="#traits-1">Traits</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages.</li>

with a single generic type, returning different concrete types based on business logic, and fixing issues related to
partial and copy traits.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-lifetimes-in-rust-2"><a class="header" href="#understanding-lifetimes-in-rust-2">Understanding Lifetimes in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces lifetimes in Rust and explains how they are used to validate
the scope of variables being passed into a function.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-lifetimes-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-lifetimes-1">Introduction to Lifetimes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lifetimes are used to validate the scope of variables being passed into a function.</li>

<ul>
<li>The speaker discusses output lifetimes and how they connect input lifetimes with output lifetimes.</li>
<li>An example is provided where two strings are passed into a function, and the longest string is returned as output.</li>
<li>The rest compiler identifies when output lifetimes do not match input lifetimes, resulting in borrowed values being
dropped too early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this section provides an introduction to lifetimes in Rust and demonstrates their importance in validating
variable scopes. Examples are provided throughout to illustrate how lifetime syntax can be implemented and how the rust
compiler can help identify errors related to borrowed values.</p>
<h2 id="dangling-pointers-and-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#dangling-pointers-and-lifetimes">Dangling Pointers and Lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This section covers the concept of dangling pointers and how lifetimes are used to prevent them in
Rust.</p>
<h3 id="dangling-pointers"><a class="header" href="#dangling-pointers">Dangling Pointers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A result returned as a string can cause a dangling pointer, which means it gets dropped and cleaned up.</li>
<li>Borrowed types as str cannot live as long as needed, causing issues with dangling pointers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetimes-in-structs"><a class="header" href="#lifetimes-in-structs">Lifetimes in Structs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lifetimes not only go into function parameters but also into structs.</li>
<li>An example is given where an excerpt needs to live for the same amount of time as the reference it holds.</li>
<li>Both the novel and excerpt need to have the same lifetime so they can be valid for the same amount of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rules-for-lifetime-elision"><a class="header" href="#rules-for-lifetime-elision">Rules for Lifetime Elision</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The compiler assigns a lifetime value to each parameter that is a reference.</li>
<li>If there’s exactly one input lifetime parameter, then there is a lifetime parameter assigned to all of the output.</li>
<li>If there are multiple input lifetime parameters but one of them is a reference to self or mutable self, then the
lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-lifetimes-in-rust-3"><a class="header" href="#understanding-lifetimes-in-rust-3">Understanding Lifetimes in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: In this video, the presenter explains how lifetimes work in Rust. He covers the three elision rules
and how they apply to functions and methods with multiple parameters. He also discusses how to use traits and generics
with lifetimes.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-rules-for-functions"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-rules-for-functions">Lifetime Rules for Functions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each parameter gets its own lifetime.</li>
<li>Rule two does not apply because there are multiple parameters.</li>
<li>Rule three doesn’t apply because there’s no method.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specifying-output-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#specifying-output-lifetime">Specifying Output Lifetime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When a function has two different parameters, it is unclear what the lifetime of the output should be.</li>
<li>The programmer must manually insert the appropriate lifetime into the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetime-rules-for-methods"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-rules-for-methods">Lifetime Rules for Methods</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each parameter gets its own lifetime.</li>
<li>Since there is more than one parameter, rule two does not apply.</li>
<li>If a method references <code>self</code>, then the return type must have the same lifetime as <code>self</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static-lifetime-1"><a class="header" href="#static-lifetime-1">Static Lifetime</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>static</code> is a special type of lifetime that applies to variables or data that needs to be around for the entirety of
an application running.</li>
<li>If a compiler suggests using <code>static</code> but it doesn’t seem appropriate, check if any functions used within that code
need their lifetimes adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-scenarios"><a class="header" href="#advanced-scenarios">Advanced Scenarios</a></h2>
<p>The presenter briefly mentions advanced scenarios where traits and lifetimes can be used together. For more information
on these topics, refer to Chapter 17 of “The Rust Programming Language” book or check out the Rust reference
documentation.</p>
<p>Overall, this video provides a clear explanation of how lifetimes work in Rust and offers helpful tips for working with
them effectively.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-rust-programming-language"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-rust-programming-language">Introduction to Rust Programming Language</a></h2>
<p>Section Overview: This video is an introductory course on the fundamentals and syntax of the Rust programming language.
The instructor will cover what Rust is, its relevance in web development, and how it compares to other systems
languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-rust-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-rust-1">What is Rust?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust is a fast and powerful programming language known for being a systems language.</li>
<li>It’s best suited for building drivers, compilers, and other tools that programmers use in development.</li>
<li>Rust is becoming relevant in web development because of WebAssembly, which allows us to build secure, portable, and
fast web applications using languages like C++ and Rust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="garbage-collection"><a class="header" href="#garbage-collection">Garbage Collection</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest advantages of Rust is that it doesn’t have garbage collection.</li>
<li>In JavaScript, for example, garbage collection can take multiple seconds depending on the program.</li>
<li>With languages like C++ you have to manage all memory allocation yourself which makes programming much harder.</li>
<li>In contrast with both these approaches, Rust checks memory usage only when needed. If the heap gets close to being
full or above some threshold it will then look for variables to free up memory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cargo-package-manager"><a class="header" href="#cargo-package-manager">Cargo Package Manager</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust has its own package manager called Cargo which is similar to NPM for Node.js or Composer for PHP.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>rustup is a version manager that can be used to check for updates with rustup update.</li>
<li>Russ C is the compiler.</li>
<li>Cargo is the package manager.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-a-rust-file-and-compiling-it"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-rust-file-and-compiling-it">Creating a Rust File and Compiling It</a></h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="initializing-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#initializing-a-project-with-cargo">Initializing a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Initialize a project in an existing folder using cargo init.</li>
<li>The project structure includes a Cargo.toml file for application info and dependencies, a .gitignore file, and a

<h2 id="in-rust-what-is-associate-type-what-is-generic-associate-type"><a class="header" href="#in-rust-what-is-associate-type-what-is-generic-associate-type">in rust, what is associate type, what is generic associate type.</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, an associate type is a type placeholder that is defined within the bounds of a trait. It allows a trait to specify that concrete types used to implement the trait must provide a specific type, without requiring the trait to know what that type is.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a trait with an associate type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">trait Iterator {
type Item;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The Item type in this example is an associate type. It is used to specify the type of the value that will be returned by the next method.</p>
<p>A generic associate type is similar, but it allows the trait to specify that the concrete type must itself be generic, and the trait can use parameters to specify constraints on the types used to implement it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a trait with a generic associate type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">trait Iterator&lt;T&gt; {
type Item: Borrow&lt;T&gt;;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the Item type is a generic associate type. It is used to specify that the type of the value returned by next must implement the Borrow trait for the type T. This allows the trait to constrain the types that can be used to implement it, while still allowing the implementor to choose
the specific type.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-differences-between-associate-type-generic-type-and-generic-associate-type"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-differences-between-associate-type-generic-type-and-generic-associate-type">what are the differences between associate type, generic type and generic associate type</a></h2>
<p>An associate type is a type placeholder that is defined within the bounds of a trait and is used to specify a type that must be provided by any concrete types that implement the trait. It allows the trait to specify a type without knowing what that type is.</p>
<p>A generic type is a type placeholder that is defined within the bounds of a struct, enum, or function and is used to specify a type that will be provided when the struct, enum, or function is instantiated. It allows the struct, enum, or function to be generic over the type.</p>
<p>A generic associate type is similar to a generic type, but it is defined within the bounds of a trait and is used to specify a type that must be provided by any concrete types that implement the trait. It allows the trait to specify a type that is itself generic, and it can use parameters to specify
constraints on the types used to implement it.</p>
<p>Here is an example that shows all three types in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">// A generic struct with a generic type parameter `T`
struct Container&lt;T&gt; {
item: T,
}

// A trait with an associate type `Item`
trait Iterator {

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}

// A struct that implements the `Iterator` trait and specifies the `Item` type
struct Counter {
count: u32,
}

impl Iterator for Counter {
type Item = u32;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        if self.count &gt; 0 {
            self.count -= 1;
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

// A trait with a generic associate type `Item` that is constrained by the trait parameter `T`
trait Iterator2&lt;T&gt; {
type Item: Borrow&lt;T&gt;;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}

// A struct that implements the `Iterator2` trait and specifies the `Item` type
struct Counter2&lt;T&gt; {
item: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Iterator2&lt;T&gt; for Counter2&lt;T&gt; {
type Item = Container&lt;T&gt;;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        Some(Container { item: self.item })
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>In this example, T is a generic type</li>
<li>Item is an associate type</li>
<li>and Item: Borrow<T> is a generic associate type.</li>
<li>The Counter struct implements the Iterator trait and specifies the concrete type u32 for the Item associate type.</li>
<li>The Counter2 struct implements the Iterator2 trait and specifies the
Container<T> struct for the Item generic associate type.</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="foreword"><a class="header" href="#foreword">Foreword</a></h1>
<p>It wasn’t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally
about <em>empowerment</em>: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust
empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of
domains than you did before.</p>
<p>Take, for example, “systems-level” work that deals with low-level details of
memory management, data representation, and concurrency. Traditionally, this
realm of programming is seen as arcane, accessible only to a select few who
have devoted the necessary years learning to avoid its infamous pitfalls. And
even those who practice it do so with caution, lest their code be open to
exploits, crashes, or corruption.</p>
<p>Rust breaks down these barriers by eliminating the old pitfalls and providing a
friendly, polished set of tools to help you along the way. Programmers who need
to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on
the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn
the fine points of a fickle toolchain. Better yet, the language is designed to
guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed
and memory usage.</p>
<p>Programmers who are already working with low-level code can use Rust to raise
their ambitions. For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively
low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you. And
you can tackle more aggressive optimizations in your code with the confidence
that you won’t accidentally introduce crashes or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>But Rust isn’t limited to low-level systems programming. It’s expressive and
ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of code
quite pleasant to write — you’ll find simple examples of both later in the
book. Working with Rust allows you to build skills that transfer from one
domain to another; you can learn Rust by writing a web app, then apply those
same skills to target your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This book fully embraces the potential of Rust to empower its users. It’s a
friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your
knowledge of Rust, but also your reach and confidence as a programmer in
general. So dive in, get ready to learn—and welcome to the Rust community!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>, an introductory book about Rust.
The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful
technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle
traditionally associated with such control.</p>
<h2 id="who-rust-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-rust-is-for">Who Rust Is For</a></h2>
<p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of
the most important groups.</p>
<h3 id="teams-of-developers"><a class="header" href="#teams-of-developers">Teams of Developers</a></h3>
<p>Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of
developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code
is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught
only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced
developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working
alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s
logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>
<p>Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding,
compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust
ecosystem.</li>
<li>The Rustfmt formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style across
developers.</li>
<li>The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
integration for code completion and inline error messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.</p>
<h3 id="students"><a class="header" href="#students">Students</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems
concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating
systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer
student questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to
make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to
programming.</p>
<h3 id="companies"><a class="header" href="#companies">Companies</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety of
tasks, including command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded
devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies,
bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine
learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-developers"><a class="header" href="#open-source-developers">Open Source Developers</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community,
developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust
language.</p>
<h3 id="people-who-value-speed-and-stability"><a class="header" href="#people-who-value-speed-and-stability">People Who Value Speed and Stability</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we
mean both how quickly Rust code can run and the speed at which Rust lets you
write programs. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature
additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle legacy code in
languages without these checks, which developers are often afraid to modify. By
striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to
lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe
code be fast code as well.</p>
<p>The Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those mentioned
here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest
ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for
decades by providing safety <em>and</em> productivity, speed <em>and</em> ergonomics. Give
Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book Is For</a></h2>
<p>This book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but
doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the material
broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We
don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming <em>is</em> or how to think
about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be better served by
reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</a></h2>
<p>In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to
back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier
chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic but will revisit
the topic in a later chapter.</p>
<p>You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project
chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project
chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so
far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” program,
and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. Chapter 2 is a
hands-on introduction to writing a program in Rust, having you build up a
number guessing game. Here we cover concepts at a high level, and later
chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get your hands dirty
right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. Chapter 3 covers Rust features
that are similar to those of other programming languages, and in Chapter 4
you’ll learn about Rust’s ownership system. If you’re a particularly meticulous
learner who prefers to learn every detail before moving on to the next, you
might want to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter 3, returning to Chapter
2 when you’d like to work on a project applying the details you’ve learned.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums, <code>match</code>
expressions, and the <code>if let</code> control flow construct. You’ll use structs and
enums to make custom types in Rust.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy rules
for organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface
(API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data structures that the
standard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9
explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the power
to define code that applies to multiple types. Chapter 11 is all about testing,
which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s
logic is correct. In Chapter 12, we’ll build our own implementation of a subset
of functionality from the <code>grep</code> command line tool that searches for text
within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the
previous chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come from
functional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more
depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.
Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the
traits that enable their functionality.</p>
<p>In Chapter 16, we’ll walk through different models of concurrent programming
and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly.
Chapter 17 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming
principles you might be familiar with.</p>
<p>Chapter 18 is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are powerful
ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs. Chapter 19 contains a
smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and
more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.</p>
<p>In Chapter 20, we’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-level
multithreaded web server!</p>
<p>Finally, some appendices contain useful information about the language in a
more reference-like format. Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B
covers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers derivable traits
provided by the standard library, Appendix D covers some useful development
tools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions. In Appendix F, you can find
translations of the book, and in Appendix G we’ll cover how Rust is made and
what nightly Rust is.</p>
<p>There is no wrong way to read this book: if you want to skip ahead, go for it!
You might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you experience any
confusion. But do whatever works for you.</p>
<p><span id="ferris"></span></p>
<p>An important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to read the
error messages the compiler displays: these will guide you toward working code.
As such, we’ll provide many examples that don’t compile along with the error
message the compiler will show you in each situation. Know that if you enter
and run a random example, it may not compile! Make sure you read the
surrounding text to see whether the example you’re trying to run is meant to
error. Ferris will also help you distinguish code that isn’t meant to work:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Ferris</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td><img src="img/ferris/not_desired_behavior.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris with one claw up, shrugging"/></td><td>This code does not produce the desired behavior.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code that
doesn’t compile.</p>

<p>The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, a
command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You’ll need
an internet connection for the download.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you prefer not to use <code>rustup</code> for some reason, please see the
<a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">Other Rust Installation Methods page</a> for more options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that
compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might
differ slightly between versions because Rust often improves error messages and
warnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install using
these steps should work as expected with the content of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="command-line-notation"><a class="header" href="#command-line-notation">Command Line Notation</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with <code>$</code>. You
don’t need to type the <code>$</code> character; it’s the command line prompt shown to
indicate the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with <code>$</code> typically
show the output of the previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific
examples will use <code>&gt;</code> rather than <code>$</code>.</p>

<h3 id="installing-rustup-on-linux-or-macos"><a class="header" href="#installing-rustup-on-linux-or-macos">Installing <code>rustup</code> on Linux or macOS</a></h3>
<p>If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the <code>rustup</code>
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rust is installed now. Great!
</code></pre>
<p>You will also need a <em>linker</em>, which is a program that Rust uses to join its
compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get
linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a
linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on
C code and will need a C compiler.</p>
<p>On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<p>Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
the <code>build-essential</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="installing-rustup-on-windows"><a class="header" href="#installing-rustup-on-windows">Installing <code>rustup</code> on Windows</a></h3>
<p>On Windows, go to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a> and follow
the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll
receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for
Visual Studio 2013 or later.</p>
<p>To acquire the build tools, you’ll need to install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio
2022</a>. When asked which workloads to install, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Desktop Development with C++”</li>
<li>The Windows 10 or 11 SDK</li>
<li>The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of
your choosing</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this book uses commands that work in both <em>cmd.exe</em> and PowerShell.
If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.</p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p>To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this
line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc --version
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest
stable version that has been released, in the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
</code></pre>
<p>If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don’t
see this information, check that Rust is in your <code>%PATH%</code> system variable as
follows.</p>
<p>In Windows CMD, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; echo %PATH%
</code></pre>
<p>In PowerShell, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; echo $env:Path

<h3 id="updating-and-uninstalling"><a class="header" href="#updating-and-uninstalling">Updating and Uninstalling</a></h3>
<p>Once Rust is installed via <code>rustup</code>, updating to a newly released version is
easy. From your shell, run the following update script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup update

<p>To uninstall Rust and <code>rustup</code>, run the following uninstall script from your
shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup self uninstall
</code></pre>
<h3 id="local-documentation"><a class="header" href="#local-documentation">Local Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so
that you can read it offline. Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation

<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes
no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so
if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of
the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some
degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s documentation for details. The Rust
team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support via <code>rust-analyzer</code>. See
<a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a><!-- ignore --> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-directory"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</a></h3>
<p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter
to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book,
we suggest making a <em>projects</em> directory in your home directory and keeping all
your projects there.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a <em>projects</em> directory
and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the <em>projects</em> directory.</p>
<p>For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>For Windows CMD, enter this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; mkdir &quot;%USERPROFILE%\projects&quot;
&gt; cd /d &quot;%USERPROFILE%\projects&quot;
&gt; mkdir hello_world
&gt; cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <em>main.rs</em>. Rust files always end with
the <em>.rs</em> extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, the
convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use
<em>hello_world.rs</em> rather than <em>helloworld.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Now open the <em>main.rs</em> file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 1-1: A program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></span></p>
<p>Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the
<em>~/projects/hello_world</em> directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following
commands to compile and run the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, enter the command <code>.\main.exe</code> instead of <code>./main</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; rustc main.rs
&gt; .\main.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Regardless of your operating system, the string <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to
the terminal. If you don’t see this output, refer back to the
<a href="ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting">“Troubleshooting”</a><!-- ignore --> part of the Installation
section for ways to get help.</p>
<p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust
program. That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it
is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the
first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all
function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same
line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can
use an automatic formatter tool called <code>rustfmt</code> to format your code in a
particular style (more on <code>rustfmt</code> in
<a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a><!-- ignore -->). The Rust team has included this tool
with the standard Rust distribution, as <code>rustc</code> is, so it should already be
installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function holds the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the
screen. There are four important details to notice here.</p>
<p>First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>Second, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it
would be entered as <code>println</code> (without the <code>!</code>). We’ll discuss Rust macros in
more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code>
means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros
don’t always follow the same rules as functions.</p>
<p>Third, you see the <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> string. We pass this string as an argument
to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed to the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (<code>;</code>), which indicates that this
expression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code
end with a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</a></h3>
<p>You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the
process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by
entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing it the name of your source file, like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to <code>gcc</code>
or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by
entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ls
main  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll
see the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD on Windows, you
would enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <em>.rs</em> extension, the executable file
(<em>main.exe</em> on Windows, but <em>main</em> on all other platforms), and, when using
Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <em>.pdb</em> extension.
From here, you run the <em>main</em> or <em>main.exe</em> file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows
</code></pre>
<p>If your <em>main.rs</em> is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints <code>Hello, world!</code> to your terminal.</p>
<p>If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or
JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as
separate steps. Rust is an <em>ahead-of-time compiled</em> language, meaning you can
compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it
even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a <em>.rb</em>, <em>.py</em>, or
<em>.js</em> file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation
installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to
compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your
code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="hello-cargo"><a class="header" href="#hello-cargo">Hello, Cargo!</a></h2>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool
to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you,
such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and
building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs
<em>dependencies</em>.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any
dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it would
only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you write more
complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project
using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this book
assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust if you
used the official installers discussed in the
<a href="ch01-01-installation.html#installation">“Installation”</a><!-- ignore --> section. If you installed Rust
through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the
following in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as <code>command not found</code>, look at the documentation for your method of installation to
determine how to install Cargo separately.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-with-cargo">Creating a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<p>Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our
original “Hello, world!” project. Navigate back to your <em>projects</em> directory
(or wherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system,
run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
</code></pre>
<p>The first command creates a new directory and project called <em>hello_cargo</em>.
We’ve named our project <em>hello_cargo</em>, and Cargo creates its files in a
directory of the same name.</p>
<p>Go into the <em>hello_cargo</em> directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo
has generated two files and one directory for us: a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and a
<em>src</em> directory with a <em>main.rs</em> file inside.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <em>.gitignore</em> file.
Git files won’t be generated if you run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git
repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change <code>cargo new</code> to
use a different version control system or no version control system by using
the <code>--vcs</code> flag. Run <code>cargo new --help</code> to see the available options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the
code in Listing 1-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_cargo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 1-2: Contents of <em>Cargo.toml</em> generated by <code>cargo new</code></span></p>
<p>This file is in the <a href="https://toml.io"><em>TOML</em></a><!-- ignore --> (<em>Tom’s Obvious, Minimal
Language</em>) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the
following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to
this file, we’ll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile
your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We’ll talk
about the <code>edition</code> key in <a href="appendix-05-editions.html">Appendix E</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any
of your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as
<em>crates</em>. We won’t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the
first project in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Now open <em>src/main.rs</em> and take a look:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one we
wrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the
project Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the <em>src</em> directory
and we have a <em>Cargo.toml</em> configuration file in the top directory.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <em>src</em> directory. The
top-level project directory is just for README files, license information,
configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo
helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and
everything is in its place.</p>
<p>If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello,
world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the
project code into the <em>src</em> directory and create an appropriate <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running-a-cargo-project">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3>
<p>Now let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the “Hello, world!”
program with Cargo! From your <em>hello_cargo</em> directory, build your project by
entering the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <em>target/debug/hello_cargo</em> (or
<em>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</em> on Windows) rather than in your current
directory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in
a directory named <em>debug</em>. You can run the executable with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal. Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top
level: <em>Cargo.lock</em>. This file keeps track of the exact versions of
dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo
manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with <code>cargo build</code> and ran it with
<code>./target/debug/hello_cargo</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the
code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient than having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn’t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling
<code>hello_cargo</code>. Cargo figured out that the files hadn’t changed, so it didn’t
rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo
would have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this
output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks
your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster than
<code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you’re
continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As
such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code> periodically as they write their
program to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they’re
ready to use the executable.</p>
<p>Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using
<code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code,
Cargo stores it in the <em>target/debug</em> directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no
matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no
longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-release"><a class="header" href="#building-for-release">Building for Release</a></h3>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an
executable in <em>target/release</em> instead of <em>target/debug</em>. The optimizations
make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes
for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one
for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for
building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt
repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your
code’s running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with
the executable in <em>target/release</em>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-as-convention"><a class="header" href="#cargo-as-convention">Cargo as Convention</a></h3>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using
<code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it’s much easier to
let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real
tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any
existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code
using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ git clone example.org/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about Cargo, check out <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter,
you’ve learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code></li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation</li>
<li>Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using <code>rustc</code> directly</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading
and writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we’ll build a guessing game program.
If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in
Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="programming-a-guessing-game"><a class="header" href="#programming-a-guessing-game">Programming a Guessing Game</a></h1>
<p>Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This
chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use
them in a real program. You’ll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we’ll explore
these ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you’ll just practice the
fundamentals.</p>
<p>We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s
how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It
will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the
program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is
correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-new-project">Setting Up a New Project</a></h2>
<p>To set up a new project, go to the <em>projects</em> directory that you created in
Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game
</code></pre>
<p>The first command, <code>cargo new</code>, takes the name of the project (<code>guessing_game</code>)
as the first argument. The second command changes to the new project’s
directory.</p>
<p>Look at the generated <em>Cargo.toml</em> file:</p>

<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, <code>cargo new</code> generates a “Hello, world!” program for
you. Check out the <em>src/main.rs</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

<p>Now let’s compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same step
using the <code>cargo run</code> command:</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,
as we’ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before moving on to
the next one.</p>
<p>Reopen the <em>src/main.rs</em> file. You’ll be writing all the code in this file.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-guess"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-guess">Processing a Guess</a></h2>
<p>The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process
that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll
allow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into
<em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;

<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-1: Code that gets a guess from the user and
prints it</span></p>
<p>This code contains a lot of information, so let’s go over it line by line. To
obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the
<code>io</code> input/output library into scope. The <code>io</code> library comes from the standard
library, known as <code>std</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it
brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the <em>prelude</em>, and
you can see everything in it <a href="../std/prelude/index.html">in the standard library documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type
into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code> statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library
provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.</p>
<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the
program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there
are no parameters; and the curly bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function.</p>
<p>As you also learned in Chapter 1, <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to
the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input
from the user.</p>
<h3 id="storing-values-with-variables"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-with-variables">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3>
<p>Next, we’ll create a <em>variable</em> to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let mut guess = String::new();
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now the program is getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little
line. We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here’s another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let apples = 5;
</code></pre>
<p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value 5. In
Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a
value, the value won’t change. We’ll be discussing this concept in detail in
the <a href="ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability">“Variables and Mutability”</a><!-- ignore -->
section in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the
variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>//</code> syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the
line. Rust ignores everything in comments. We’ll discuss comments in more
detail in <a href="ch03-04-comments.html">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that <code>let mut guess</code> will
introduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we
want to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is
the value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result of calling
<code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>.
<a href="../std/string/struct.String.html"><code>String</code></a><!-- ignore --> is a string type provided by the standard
library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated
function of the <code>String</code> type. An <em>associated function</em> is a function that’s
implemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a
new, empty string. You’ll find a <code>new</code> function on many types because it’s a
common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.</p>
<p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable
variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a <code>String</code>. Whew!</p>
<h3 id="receiving-user-input"><a class="header" href="#receiving-user-input">Receiving User Input</a></h3>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line of the program. Now we’ll call
the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user
input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
<span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we hadn’t imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of
the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as
<code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance of
<a href="../std/io/struct.Stdin.html"><code>std::io::Stdin</code></a><!-- ignore -->, which is a type that represents a
handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <a href="../std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line"><code>read_line</code></a><!--
ignore --> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.
We’re also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what
string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take
whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string
(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an
argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the
string’s content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a <em>reference</em>, which gives you a way to
let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to
copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,
and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use
references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this
program. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are
immutable by default. Hence, you need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than
<code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more
thoroughly.)</p>

<p>We’re still working on this line of code. We’re now discussing a third line of
text, but note that it’s still part of a single logical line of code. The next
part is this method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We could have written this code as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess).expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. It’s
often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long
lines when you call a method with the <code>.method_name()</code> syntax. Now let’s
discuss what this line does.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string
we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <a href="../std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a><!--
ignore --> is an <a href="ch06-00-enums.html"><em>enumeration</em></a><!-- ignore -->, often called an <em>enum</em>,
which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each
possible state a <em>variant</em>.</p>
<p><a href="ch06-00-enums.html">Chapter 6</a><!-- ignore --> will cover enums in more detail. The purpose
of these <code>Result</code> types is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>’s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the
operation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value.
The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information
about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on
them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <a href="../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect"><code>expect</code> method</a><!-- ignore -->
that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code>
will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would
likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.
If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return
value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.
In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.</p>
<p>If you don’t call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build

<p>Rust warns that you haven’t used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>,
indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code,
but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we
can use <code>expect</code>. You’ll learn about recovering from errors in <a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">Chapter
9</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<h3 id="printing-values-with-println-placeholders"><a class="header" href="#printing-values-with-println-placeholders">Printing Values with <code>println!</code> Placeholders</a></h3>
<p>Aside from the closing curly bracket, there’s only one more line to discuss in
the code so far:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This line prints the string that now contains the user’s input. The <code>{}</code> set of
curly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold
a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can
go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an
expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the
format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty
curly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result
of an expression in one call to <code>println!</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!(&quot;x = {x} and y + 2 = {}&quot;, y + 2);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code would print <code>x = 5 and y = 12</code>.</p>
<h3 id="testing-the-first-part"><a class="header" href="#testing-the-first-part">Testing the First Part</a></h3>
<p>Let’s test the first part of the guessing game. Run it using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>

<p>At this point, the first part of the game is done: we’re getting input from the
keyboard and then printing it.</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-secret-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-secret-number">Generating a Secret Number</a></h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The
secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more
than once. We’ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn’t too
difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard
library. However, the Rust team does provide a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rand"><code>rand</code> crate</a> with
said functionality.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><a class="header" href="#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project
we’ve been building is a <em>binary crate</em>, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code>
crate is a <em>library crate</em>, which contains code that is intended to be used in
other programs and can’t be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo’s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we
can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to
include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the
following line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that
Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with
this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:
* ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.md
* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md
-->
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, everything that follows a header is part of that
section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you
tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of
those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the
semantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic
Versioning</a><!-- ignore --> (sometimes called <em>SemVer</em>), which is a
standard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually
shorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but
below 0.9.0.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version
0.8.5, and this specification ensures you’ll get the latest patch release that
will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or greater
is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples use.</p>
<p>Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown in
Listing 2-2.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-2: The output from running <code>cargo build</code> after
adding the rand crate as a dependency</span></p>
<p>You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the
code, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating
system), and the lines may be in a different order.</p>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of
everything that dependency needs from the <em>registry</em>, which is a copy of data
from <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem
post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and
downloads any crates listed that aren’t already downloaded. In this case,
although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates
that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles
them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you
won’t get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already
downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven’t changed anything
about them in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. Cargo also knows that you haven’t changed
anything about your code, so it doesn’t recompile that either. With nothing to
do, it simply exits.</p>
<p>If you open the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, make a trivial change, and then save it and
build again, you’ll only see two lines of output:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

</code></pre>
<p>These lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows it can
reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.</p>

<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time
you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the
dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that
next week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version
contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will
break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file the first
time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <em>guessing_game</em>
directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions
of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the
<em>Cargo.lock</em> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see
that the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file exists and will use the versions specified there
rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will
remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file.
Because the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file is important for reproducible builds, it’s often
checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4>
<p>When you <em>do</em> want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>,
which will ignore the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file and figure out all the latest versions
that fit your specifications in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. Cargo will then write those
versions to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look
for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the <code>rand</code> crate has
released the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.9.0, you would see the following if
you ran <code>cargo update</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo update

</code></pre>
<p>Cargo ignores the 0.9.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a change
in your <em>Cargo.lock</em> file noting that the version of the <code>rand</code> crate you are
now using is 0.8.6. To use <code>rand</code> version 0.9.0 or any version in the 0.9.<em>x</em>
series, you’d have to update the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to look like this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.9.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The next time you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will update the registry of crates
available and reevaluate your <code>rand</code> requirements according to the new version
you have specified.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to say about <a href="http://doc.crates.io">Cargo</a><!-- ignore --> and <a href="http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html">its
ecosystem</a><!-- ignore -->, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 14, but
for now, that’s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse
libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled
from a number of packages.</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-random-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-random-number">Generating a Random Number</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start using <code>rand</code> to generate a number to guess. The next step is to
update <em>src/main.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 2-3.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {secret_number}&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-3: Adding code to generate a random
number</span></p>
<p>First we add the line <code>use rand::Rng;</code>. The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that
random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to
use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Next, we’re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the
<code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number
generator we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of
execution and is seeded by the operating system. Then we call the <code>gen_range</code>
method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code>
trait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng;</code> statement. The
<code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a
random number in the range. The kind of range expression we’re using here takes
the form <code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we
need to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions
to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for
using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies
locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other
functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and
click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we’re
developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll delete it from the
final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon
as it starts!</p>
<p>Try running the program a few times:</p>

}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-4: Handling the possible return values of
comparing two numbers</span></p>
<p>First we add another <code>use</code> statement, bringing a type called
<code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library. The <code>Ordering</code> type
is another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>. These are
the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type. The
<code>cmp</code> method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be
compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s
comparing <code>guess</code> to <code>secret_number</code>. Then it returns a variant of the
<code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement. We use a
<a href="ch06-02-match.html"><code>match</code></a><!-- ignore --> expression to decide what to do next based on
which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values
in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of <em>arms</em>. An arm consists of a <em>pattern</em> to
match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code>
fits that arm’s pattern. Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks
through each arm’s pattern in turn. Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are
powerful Rust features: they let you express a variety of situations your code
might encounter and they make sure you handle them all. These features will be
covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that
the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is
38.</p>
<p>When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return
<code>Ordering::Greater</code> because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets
the <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm’s pattern. It looks
at the first arm’s pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value
<code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in
that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm’s pattern is
<code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which <em>does</em> match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated
code in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code>
expression ends after the first successful match, so it won’t look at the last
arm in this scenario.</p>
<p>However, the code in Listing 2-4 won’t compile yet. Let’s try it:</p>

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are <em>mismatched types</em>. Rust has a
strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote
<code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be
a <code>String</code> and didn’t make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other
hand, is a number type. A few of Rust’s number types can have a value between 1
and 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a
64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to
an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information
elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason
for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a
real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do
so by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>

<p>The line is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(&quot;Please type a number!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn’t the program already have
a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the
previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. <em>Shadowing</em> lets us reuse the <code>guess</code>
variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as
<code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code>, for example. We’ll cover this in more detail in
<a href="ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->, but for now, know that this feature is
often used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.</p>
<p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code>
in the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the
input as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any
whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the
string to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press
<span class="keystroke">enter</span> to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their
guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user
types <span class="keystroke">5</span> and presses <span
class="keystroke">enter</span>, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code>
represents “newline.” (On Windows, pressing <span
class="keystroke">enter</span> results in a carriage return and a newline,
<code>\r\n</code>.) The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, resulting in just <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../std/primitive.str.html#method.parse"><code>parse</code> method on strings</a><!-- ignore --> converts a string to
another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to
tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon
(<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a
few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.
It’s a good default choice for a small positive number. You’ll learn about
other number types in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this example program and the comparison
with <code>secret_number</code> means Rust will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a
<code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same
type!</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted
into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string
contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it
might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code>
method does (discussed earlier in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-result">“Handling Potential Failure with
<code>Result</code>”</a><!-- ignore-->). We’ll treat
this <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code>
returns an <code>Err</code> <code>Result</code> variant because it couldn’t create a number from the
string, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the message we give it.
If <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the
<code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from
the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>

<h3 id="handling-invalid-input"><a class="header" href="#handling-invalid-input">Handling Invalid Input</a></h3>
<p>To further refine the game’s behavior, rather than crashing the program when
the user inputs a non-number, let’s make the game ignore a non-number so the
user can continue guessing. We can do that by altering the line where <code>guess</code>
is converted from a <code>String</code> to a <code>u32</code>, as shown in Listing 2-5.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-5: Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for
another guess instead of crashing the program</span></p>
<p>We switch from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression to move from crashing
on an error to handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code> returns a <code>Result</code>
type and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. We’re using
a <code>match</code> expression here, as we did with the <code>Ordering</code> result of the <code>cmp</code>
method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will
return an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resultant number. That <code>Ok</code> value will
match the first arm’s pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the
<code>num</code> value that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number
will end up right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we’re creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is <em>not</em> able to turn the string into a number, it will return an
<code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value
does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does
match the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a
catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all <code>Err</code>
values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will
execute the second arm’s code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the
next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the
program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code> might encounter!</p>
<p>Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let’s try it:</p>

<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:
<code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next
few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3
covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data
types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores
ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5
discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-programming-concepts"><a class="header" href="#common-programming-concepts">Common Programming Concepts</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain the conventions
around using these concepts.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning
them early will give you a strong core to start from.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="keywords"><a class="header" href="#keywords">Keywords</a></h4>
<p>The Rust language has a set of <em>keywords</em> that are reserved for use by the
language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find a list of the keywords in <a href="appendix-01-keywords.html">Appendix A</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>

<li>by default, variables are immutable.</li>
<li>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value.</li>
<li>Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with
underscores between words.</li>
<li>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code> because we’ll get a
compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without
using the <code>let</code> keyword.</li>
<li>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can
change the type of the value but reuse the same name.</li>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables">“Storing Values with
Variables”</a><!-- ignore --> section, by default,
variables are immutable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write
your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that
Rust offers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.
Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why
sometimes you might want to opt out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change
that value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To illustrate this, generate a new project called <em>variables</em> in
your <em>projects</em> directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in your new <em>variables</em> directory, open <em>src/main.rs</em> and replace its
code with the following code, which won’t compile just yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error message
regarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program
isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet;</li>
<li>they do <em>not</em> mean that you’re
not a good programmer!</li>
<li>Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>You received the error message</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
</code></pre>
<p>because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that’s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to
bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will
never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible
that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do.</li>
<li>The cause
of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only <em>sometimes</em>.</li>
<li>The Rust
compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t change, it really
won’t change, so you don’t have to keep track of it yourself.</li>
<li>Your code is thus
easier to reason through.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by
adding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables">Chapter
2</a><!-- ignore -->.</li>
<li>Adding <code>mut</code> also conveys
intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code
will be changing this variable’s value.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s change <em>src/main.rs</em> to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run the program now, we get this:</p>

The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We’re allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> when <code>mut</code> is
used.</li>
<li>Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and
depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constants-1"><a class="header" href="#constants-1">Constants</a></h2>
<p>Like immutable variables, <em>constants</em> are values that are bound to a name and
are not allowed to change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but there are a few differences between constants and variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>First, you aren’t allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Constants aren’t just
immutable by default—they’re always immutable.</li>
<li>You declare constants using the
<code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value <em>must</em>
be annotated.</li>
<li>We’ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,
<a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data Types,”</a><!-- ignore -->, so don’t worry about the details
right now.</li>
<li>Just know that you must always annotate the type.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes
them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,
not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s an example of a constant declaration:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>The constant’s name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code> and its value is set to the
result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number
of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program).</li>
<li>Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with
underscores between words.</li>
<li>The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of
operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a
way that’s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant
to the value 10,800.</li>
<li>See the <a href="../reference/const_eval.html">Rust Reference’s section on constant
evaluation</a> for more information on what operations can be used
when declaring constants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in
which they were declared.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This property makes constants useful for values in
your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to
earn, or the speed of light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in
conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also
helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shadowing"><a class="header" href="#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h2>
<p>As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">Chapter 2</a><!-- ignore -->, you can declare a
new variable with the same name as a previous variable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rustaceans say that the
first variable is <em>shadowed</em> by the second, which means that the second
variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the
variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.
We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the
use of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!(&quot;The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}&quot;);
    }

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of <code>5</code>.</li>
<li>Then it creates a new variable
<code>x</code> by repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the original value and adding <code>1</code> so the
value of <code>x</code> is then <code>6</code>.</li>
<li>Then, within an inner scope created with the curly
brackets, the third <code>let</code> statement also shadows <code>x</code> and creates a new
variable, multiplying the previous value by <code>2</code> to give <code>x</code> a value of <code>12</code>.</li>
<li>When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and <code>x</code> returns to being <code>6</code>.
When we run this program, it will output the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code> because we’ll get a
compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without
using the <code>let</code> keyword.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using <code>let</code>, we can perform a few transformations
on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have
been completed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can
change the type of the value but reuse the same name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, say our
program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by
inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    let spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>The first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type and the second <code>spaces</code> variable
is a number type.</li>
<li>Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with
different names, such as <code>spaces_str</code> and <code>spaces_num</code>;</li>
<li>instead, we can reuse
the simpler <code>spaces</code> name.</li>
<li>However, if we try to use <code>mut</code> for this, as shown
here, we’ll get a compile-time error:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

<p>Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let’s look at more data types they
can have.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="data-types-1"><a class="header" href="#data-types-1">Data Types</a></h2>
<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain <em>data type</em>, which tells Rust what kind of
data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. We’ll look at
two data type subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Rust is a <em>statically typed</em> language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases
when many types are possible, such as when we converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric
type using <code>parse</code> in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">“Comparing the Guess to the Secret
Number”</a><!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let guess: u32 = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If we don’t add the <code>: u32</code> type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust
will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more
information from us to know which type we want to use:</p>

<p>You’ll see different type annotations for other data types.</p>
<h3 id="scalar-types"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types">Scalar Types</a></h3>
<p>A <em>scalar</em> type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize
these from other programming languages. Let’s jump into how they work in Rust.</p>
<h4 id="integer-types"><a class="header" href="#integer-types">Integer Types</a></h4>
<p>An <em>integer</em> is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer
type in Chapter 2, the <code>u32</code> type. This type declaration indicates that the
value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types
start with <code>i</code> instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows
the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare
the type of an integer value.</p>

<p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
<em>Signed</em> and <em>unsigned</em> refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be
negative—in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it
(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign (unsigned). It’s like writing numbers on paper: when
the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,
when it’s safe to assume the number is positive, it’s shown with no sign.
Signed numbers are stored using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two’s complement</a><!-- ignore
--> representation.</p>
<p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -
1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where <em>n</em> is the number of bits that variant uses. So an
<code>i8</code> can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, which equals
-128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1,
so a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the architecture of the
computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”:
64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit
architecture.</p>
<p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note
that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,
such as <code>57u8</code>, to designate the type. Number literals can also use <code>_</code> as a
visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as <code>1_000</code>, which will
have the same value as if you had specified <code>1000</code>.</p>

<p>So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s
defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to <code>i32</code>.
The primary situation in which you’d use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing
some sort of collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="integer-overflow"><a class="header" href="#integer-overflow">Integer Overflow</a></h5>
<p>Let’s say you have a variable of type <code>u8</code> that can hold values between 0 and
255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as
256, <em>integer overflow</em> will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.
When you’re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow
that cause your program to <em>panic</em> at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust
uses the term <em>panicking</em> when a program exits with an error; we’ll discuss
panics in more depth in the <a href="ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html">“Unrecoverable Errors with
<code>panic!</code>”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter
9.</p>
<p>When you’re compiling in release mode with the <code>--release</code> flag, Rust does
<em>not</em> include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if
overflow occurs, Rust performs <em>two’s complement wrapping</em>. In short, values
greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum
of the values the type can hold. In the case of a <code>u8</code>, the value 256 becomes
0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won’t panic, but the
variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to
have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.</p>
<p>To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families
of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap in all modes with the <code>wrapping_*</code> methods, such as <code>wrapping_add</code>.</li>
<li>Return the <code>None</code> value if there is overflow with the <code>checked_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with
the <code>overflowing_*</code> methods.</li>
<li>Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with the <code>saturating_*</code>
methods.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="floating-point-types"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-types">Floating-Point Types</a></h4>
<p>Rust also has two primitive types for <em>floating-point numbers</em>, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>
because on modern CPUs, it’s roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of
more precision. All floating-point types are signed.</p>
<p>Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The
<code>f32</code> type is a single-precision float, and <code>f64</code> has double precision.</p>
<h4 id="numeric-operations"><a class="header" href="#numeric-operations">Numeric Operations</a></h4>
<p>Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all the number
types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer
division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows
how you’d use each numeric operation in a <code>let</code> statement:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. <a href="appendix-02-operators.html">Appendix
B</a><!-- ignore --> contains a list of all operators that Rust
provides.</p>
<h4 id="the-boolean-type"><a class="header" href="#the-boolean-type">The Boolean Type</a></h4>
<p>As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in
Rust is specified using <code>bool</code>. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an <code>if</code>
expression. We’ll cover how <code>if</code> expressions work in Rust in the <a href="ch03-05-control-flow.html#control-flow">“Control
Flow”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<h4 id="the-character-type"><a class="header" href="#the-character-type">The Character Type</a></h4>
<p>Rust’s <code>char</code> type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are
some examples of declaring <code>char</code> values:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we specify <code>char</code> literals with single quotes, as opposed to string
literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s <code>char</code> type is four bytes in size and
represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than
just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji;
and zero-width spaces are all valid <code>char</code> values in Rust. Unicode Scalar
Values range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive.
However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human
intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a <code>char</code> is in
Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings">“Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with
Strings”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 8.</p>
<h3 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound Types</a></h3>
<p><em>Compound types</em> can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two
primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p>
<h4 id="the-tuple-type"><a class="header" href="#the-tuple-type">The Tuple Type</a></h4>
<p>A <em>tuple</em> is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a
variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once
declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p>
<p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the
different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional
type annotations in this example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a
single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can
use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then
uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code> and turn it into three separate
variables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called <em>destructuring</em> because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of
<code>y</code>, which is <code>6.4</code>.</p>
<p>We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by
the index of the value we want to access. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program creates the tuple <code>x</code> and then accesses each element of the tuple
using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first
index in a tuple is 0.</p>
<p>The tuple without any values has a special name, <em>unit</em>. This value and its
corresponding type are both written <code>()</code> and represent an empty value or an
empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t
return any other value.</p>
<h4 id="the-array-type"><a class="header" href="#the-array-type">The Array Type</a></h4>
<p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an <em>array</em>. Unlike
a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in
some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.</p>
<p>We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square
brackets:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than
the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap">Chapter
4</a><!-- ignore -->) or when you want to ensure you always have a
fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type,
though. A <em>vector</em> is a similar collection type provided by the standard
library that <em>is</em> allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether
to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. <a href="ch08-01-vectors.html">Chapter
8</a><!-- ignore --> discusses vectors in more detail.</p>
<p>However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not
need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a
program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know
it will always contain 12 elements:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;,
              &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You write an array’s type using square brackets with the type of each element,
a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>i32</code> is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number <code>5</code>
indicates the array contains five elements.</p>
<p>You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by
specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of
the array in square brackets, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [3; 5];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The array named <code>a</code> will contain <code>5</code> elements that will all be set to the value
<code>3</code> initially. This is the same as writing <code>let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];</code> but in a
more concise way.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-array-elements"><a class="header" href="#accessing-array-elements">Accessing Array Elements</a></h5>
<p>An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be
allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value <code>1</code> because that
is the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array. The variable named <code>second</code> will get
the value <code>2</code> from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p>
<h5 id="invalid-array-element-access"><a class="header" href="#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid Array Element Access</a></h5>
<p>Let’s see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past
the end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in
Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore panics">use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!(&quot;Please enter an array index.&quot;);

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut index)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect(&quot;Index entered was not a number&quot;);

    let element = a[index];

    println!(&quot;The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using <code>cargo run</code> and
enter <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>, the program will print out the corresponding
value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of
the array, such as <code>10</code>, you’ll see output like this:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-15-invalid-array-access
cargo run
10
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>The program resulted in a <em>runtime</em> error at the point of using an invalid
value in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and
didn’t execute the final <code>println!</code> statement. When you attempt to access an
element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less
than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length,
Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,
because the compiler can’t possibly know what value a user will enter when they
run the code later.</p>
<p>This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action. In many
low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this
kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and
continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling and how you can
write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.</p>

<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave <em>comments</em> in
their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source
code may find useful.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// hello, world
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the
comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend beyond a
single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html">“Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”</a><!-- ignore -->
section of Chapter 14.</p>

<p>The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is <code>true</code> and to
run some code repeatedly while a condition is <code>true</code> are basic building blocks

<h3 id="if-expressions"><a class="header" href="#if-expressions"><code>if</code> Expressions</a></h3>

provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block
of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”</p>
<p>Create a new project called <em>branches</em> in your <em>projects</em> directory to explore
the <code>if</code> expression. In the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, input the following:</p>

<p>All <code>if</code> expressions start with the keyword <code>if</code>, followed by a condition. In
this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable <code>number</code> has a
value less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is
<code>true</code> immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code
associated with the conditions in <code>if</code> expressions are sometimes called <em>arms</em>,
just like the arms in <code>match</code> expressions that we discussed in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">“Comparing
the Guess to the Secret Number”</a><!--
ignore --> section of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can also include an <code>else</code> expression, which we chose to do
here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the
condition evaluate to <code>false</code>. If you don’t provide an <code>else</code> expression and
the condition is <code>false</code>, the program will just skip the <code>if</code> block and move on
to the next bit of code.</p>
<p>Try running this code; you should see the following output:</p>

<p>Let’s try changing the value of <code>number</code> to a value that makes the condition

</code></pre>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code <em>must</em> be a <code>bool</code>. If
the condition isn’t a <code>bool</code>, we’ll get an error. For example, try running the
following code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    if number {

<p>The <code>if</code> condition evaluates to a value of <code>3</code> this time, and Rust throws an
error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The error indicates that Rust expected a <code>bool</code> but got an integer. Unlike
languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to
convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide
<code>if</code> with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the <code>if</code> code block to run
only when a number is not equal to <code>0</code>, for example, we can change the <code>if</code>
expression to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {

<h4 id="handling-multiple-conditions-with-else-if"><a class="header" href="#handling-multiple-conditions-with-else-if">Handling Multiple Conditions with <code>else if</code></a></h4>
<p>You can use multiple conditions by combining <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> in an <code>else if</code>
expression. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

    if number % 4 == 0 {

    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 3&quot;);
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 2&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2&quot;);

</code></pre>
<p>When this program executes, it checks each <code>if</code> expression in turn and executes
the first body for which the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>. Note that even
though 6 is divisible by 2, we don’t see the output <code>number is divisible by 2</code>,
nor do we see the <code>number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2</code> text from the <code>else</code>
block. That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first <code>true</code>
condition, and once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.</p>
<p>Using too many <code>else if</code> expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more
than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful
Rust branching construct called <code>match</code> for these cases.</p>

the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the <code>if</code> arm and the <code>else</code>
arm were <code>i32</code> integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following

</code></pre>
<p>The expression in the <code>if</code> block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in
the <code>else</code> block evaluates to a string. This won’t work because variables must
have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the
<code>number</code> variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of <code>number</code> lets the
compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use <code>number</code>. Rust wouldn’t be
able to do that if the type of <code>number</code> was only determined at runtime; the
compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code
if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.</p>
<h3 id="repetition-with-loops"><a class="header" href="#repetition-with-loops">Repetition with Loops</a></h3>
<p>It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,
Rust provides several <em>loops</em>, which will run through the code inside the loop
body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To experiment
with loops, let’s make a new project called <em>loops</em>.</p>
<p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>. Let’s try each one.</p>
<h4 id="repeating-code-with-loop"><a class="header" href="#repeating-code-with-loop">Repeating Code with <code>loop</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.</p>
<p>As an example, change the <em>src/main.rs</em> file in your <em>loops</em> directory to look
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    loop {
        println!(&quot;again!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we’ll see <code>again!</code> printed over and over continuously
until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support the keyboard
shortcut <span class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span> to interrupt a program that is
stuck in a continual loop. Give it a try:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-loop
cargo run
CTRL-C
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol <code>^C</code> represents where you pressed <span
class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span>. You may or may not see the word <code>again!</code>
printed after the <code>^C</code>, depending on where the code was in the loop when it
received the interrupt signal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You
can place the <code>break</code> keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop
executing the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the
<a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#quitting-after-a-correct-guess">“Quitting After a Correct Guess”</a><!-- ignore
--> section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when the user won the game by
guessing the correct number.</p>
<p>We also used <code>continue</code> in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program
to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the
next iteration.</p>
<h4 id="returning-values-from-loops"><a class="header" href="#returning-values-from-loops">Returning Values from Loops</a></h4>
<p>One of the uses of a <code>loop</code> is to retry an operation you know might fail, such
as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass
the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do
this, you can add the value you want returned after the <code>break</code> expression you
use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can
use it, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!(&quot;The result is {result}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before the loop, we declare a variable named <code>counter</code> and initialize it to
<code>0</code>. Then we declare a variable named <code>result</code> to hold the value returned from
the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add <code>1</code> to the <code>counter</code> variable,
and then check whether the <code>counter</code> is equal to <code>10</code>. When it is, we use the
<code>break</code> keyword with the value <code>counter * 2</code>. After the loop, we use a
semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to <code>result</code>. Finally, we
print the value in <code>result</code>, which in this case is <code>20</code>.</p>
<h4 id="loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops"><a class="header" href="#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops">Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</a></h4>
<p>If you have loops within loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> apply to the innermost
loop at that point. You can optionally specify a <em>loop label</em> on a loop that
you can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords
apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin
with a single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!(&quot;count = {count}&quot;);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!(&quot;remaining = {remaining}&quot;);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!(&quot;End count = {count}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The outer loop has the label <code>'counting_up</code>, and it will count up from 0 to 2.
The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first <code>break</code> that
doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The <code>break 'counting_up;</code> statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:</p>

remaining = 10
End count = 2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="conditional-loops-with-while"><a class="header" href="#conditional-loops-with-while">Conditional Loops with <code>while</code></a></h4>
<p>A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the
condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be <code>true</code>, the
program calls <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. It’s possible to implement behavior
like this using a combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could
try that now in a program, if you’d like. However, this pattern is so common
that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a <code>while</code> loop. In
Listing 3-3, we use <code>while</code> to loop the program three times, counting down each
time, and then, after the loop, print a message and exit.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-3: Using a <code>while</code> loop to run code while a
condition holds true</span></p>
<p>This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used
<code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>, and it’s clearer. While a condition
evaluates to <code>true</code>, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.</p>
<h4 id="looping-through-a-collection-with-for"><a class="header" href="#looping-through-a-collection-with-for">Looping Through a Collection with <code>for</code></a></h4>
<p>You can choose to use the <code>while</code> construct to loop over the elements of a
collection, such as an array. For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each
element in the array <code>a</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-4: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>while</code> loop</span></p>
<p>Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index
<code>0</code>, and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,
when <code>index &lt; 5</code> is no longer <code>true</code>). Running this code will print every
element in the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)

     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
</code></pre>
<p>All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though <code>index</code>
will reach a value of <code>5</code> at some point, the loop stops executing before trying
to fetch a sixth value from the array.</p>
<p>However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if
the index value or test condition is incorrect. For example, if you changed the
definition of the <code>a</code> array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would panic. It’s also slow, because
the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the
index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.</p>
<p>As a more concise alternative, you can use a <code>for</code> loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A <code>for</code> loop looks like the code in Listing 3-5.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {element}&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-5: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>When we run this code, we’ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More
importantly, we’ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the
chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not
going far enough and missing some items.</p>
<p>Using the <code>for</code> loop, you wouldn’t need to remember to change any other code if
you changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method
used in Listing 3-4.</p>
<p>The safety and conciseness of <code>for</code> loops make them the most commonly used loop
construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a
certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop
in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that
would be to use a <code>Range</code>, provided by the standard library, which generates
all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another
number.</p>
<p>Here’s what the countdown would look like using a <code>for</code> loop and another method
we’ve not yet talked about, <code>rev</code>, to reverse the range:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);
    }
    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code is a bit nicer, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You made it! This was a sizable chapter: you learned about variables, scalar
and compound data types, functions, comments, <code>if</code> expressions, and loops! To
practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to

<li>Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,”

<p>When you’re ready to move on, we’ll talk about a concept in Rust that <em>doesn’t</em>
commonly exist in other programming languages: ownership.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="understanding-ownership"><a class="header" href="#understanding-ownership">Understanding Ownership</a></h1>
<p>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="what-is-ownership-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ownership-1">What Is Ownership?</a></h2>
<p><em>Ownership</em> is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If
any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features
of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.</p>
<p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust
and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally
develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding
the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by
working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:
strings.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-stack-and-the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-stack-and-the-heap">The Stack and the Heap</a></h3>
<p>Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why
you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in
relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief
explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use
at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite
order. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of
plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when
you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from
the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing
onto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All
data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown
size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap
instead.</p>
<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap
that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which
is the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the
heap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em> (pushing values onto
the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a
known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want
the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a
restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and
the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If
someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to
find you.</p>
<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is
always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap
requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space
to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next
allocation.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because
you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster
if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server
at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get
all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an
order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and
then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a
processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other
data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the
heap).</p>
<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership
addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the
stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership
is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>

<h3 id="ownership-rules-1"><a class="header" href="#ownership-rules-1">Ownership Rules</a></h3>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we
work through the examples that illustrate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has an <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-scope"><a class="header" href="#variable-scope">Variable Scope</a></h3>
<p>Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the <code>fn main() {</code>
code in examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the following
examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = &quot;hello&quot;;   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is
valid</span></p>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into</em> scope, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of</em> scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-string-type"><a class="header" href="#the-string-type">The <code>String</code> Type</a></h3>
<p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than those we covered in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3. The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored
on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be
quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another
part of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to
look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to
clean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p>
<p>We’ll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These
aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by
the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in
<a href="ch08-02-strings.html">Chapter 8</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages
data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that
is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string
literal using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code>
function under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort of name like
<code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the <a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax">“Method
Syntax”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    s.push_str(&quot;, world!&quot;); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s); // This will print `hello, world!`
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>So, what’s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.</p>
<h3 id="memory-and-allocation"><a class="header" href="#memory-and-allocation">Memory and Allocation</a></h3>
<p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string
literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string
literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the
binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose
size might change while running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with
our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.</p>
<p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector
(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used
anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to
call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with
exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {
        let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs
to the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of
scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
<a href="../std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop"><code>drop</code></a><!-- ignore -->, and it’s where the author of <code>String</code> can put
the code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing
curly bracket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
lifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.
The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem
simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.</p>
<!-- Old heading. Do not remove or links may break. -->
<p><a id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-move"></a></p>
<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-move"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-move">Variables and Data Interacting with Move</a></h4>
<p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable <code>x</code>
to <code>y</code></span></p>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make
a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>. This is indeed what is happening, because integers
are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed
onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in <code>s1</code> and bind
it to <code>s2</code>. But this isn’t quite what happens.</p>
<p>Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to <code>String</code> under the
covers. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to
the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the
heap that holds the contents.</p>
<p><img alt="Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the
stack, consisting of its length (5), capacity (5), and a pointer to the first
value in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the
string data on the heap, byte by byte." src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center"
style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code>
holding the value <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> bound to <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> are
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
<code>String</code> has received from the allocator. The difference between length and
capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore the
capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the
data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code>
that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The representation does <em>not</em> look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if
the data on the heap were large.</p>
<p><img alt="Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,
and each points to its own copy of string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-03.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might
do if Rust copied the heap data as well</span></p>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the <code>drop</code> function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1;</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as
no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes
out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is
created; it won’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;

    println!(&quot;{}, world!&quot;, s1);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve heard the terms <em>shallow copy</em> and <em>deep copy</em> while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But
because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a
shallow copy, it’s known as a <em>move</em>. In this example, we would say that <code>s1</code>
was <em>moved</em> into <code>s2</code>. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.
Table s1 is grayed out be-cause s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to

50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been
invalidated</span></p>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<!-- Old heading. Do not remove or links may break. -->
<p><a id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone"></a></p>
<h4 id="variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone">Variables and Data Interacting with Clone</a></h4>
<p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called <code>clone</code>. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!(&quot;s1 = {}, s2 = {}&quot;, s1, s2);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,
where the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something
different is going on.</p>
<h4 id="stack-only-data-copy"><a class="header" href="#stack-only-data-copy">Stack-Only Data: Copy</a></h4>
<p>There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using
integers—part of which was shown in Listing 4-2—works and is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!(&quot;x = {}, y = {}&quot;, x, y);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to
<code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and wasn’t moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile
time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick
to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being
valid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference
between deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything
different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on
types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about
traits in <a href="ch10-02-traits.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code>
trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,
making them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p>
<p>Rust won’t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts,
has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen
when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,
we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation
to your type to implement the trait, see <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable
Traits”</a><!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.</p>
<p>So, what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for
the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar
values can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that
implement <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>All the floating-point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>. For example,
<code>(i32, i32)</code> implements <code>Copy</code>, but <code>(i32, String)</code> does not.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ownership-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#ownership-and-functions">Ownership and Functions</a></h3>
<p>The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations
showing where variables go into and out of scope.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope
annotated</span></p>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<h3 id="return-values-and-scope"><a class="header" href="#return-values-and-scope">Return Values and Scope</a></h3>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-4: Transferring ownership of return
values</span></p>
<p>The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by <code>drop</code> unless ownership
of the data has been moved to another variable.</p>
<p>While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every
function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but
not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to
be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting
from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.</p>
<p>Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters</span></p>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without
transferring ownership, called <em>references</em>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="references-and-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#references-and-borrowing">References and Borrowing</a></h2>
<p>The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the
<code>String</code> to the calling function so we can still use the <code>String</code> after the
call to <code>calculate_length</code>, because the <code>String</code> was moved into
<code>calculate_length</code>. Instead, we can provide a reference to the <code>String</code> value.
A <em>reference</em> is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access
the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.
Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a
particular type for the life of that reference.</p>
<p>Here is how you would define and use a <code>calculate_length</code> function that has a
reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    s.len()
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the
function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass <code>&amp;s1</code> into
<code>calculate_length</code> and, in its definition, we take <code>&amp;String</code> rather than
<code>String</code>. These ampersands represent <em>references</em>, and they allow you to refer
to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5 depicts this concept.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: the table for s contains only a pointer to the table
for s1. The table for s1 contains the stack data for s1 and points to the
string data on the heap." src="img/trpl04-05.svg" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-5: A diagram of <code>&amp;String s</code> pointing at <code>String s1</code></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The opposite of referencing by using <code>&amp;</code> is <em>dereferencing</em>, which is
accomplished with the dereference operator, <code>*</code>. We’ll see some uses of the
dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in
Chapter 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the function call here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
</span><span class="boring">    s.len()
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that <em>refers</em> to the value of <code>s1</code>
but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will
not be dropped when the reference stops being used.</p>
<p>Likewise, the signature of the function uses <code>&amp;</code> to indicate that the type of
the parameter <code>s</code> is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);

</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The scope in which the variable <code>s</code> is valid is the same as any function
parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped
when <code>s</code> stops being used, because <code>s</code> doesn’t have ownership. When functions
have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to
return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had
ownership.</p>
<p>We call the action of creating a reference <em>borrowing</em>. As in real life, if a
person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have
to give it back. You don’t own it.</p>
<p>So, what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Try the code in

<p>Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not
allowed to modify something we have a reference to.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-references-3"><a class="header" href="#mutable-references-3">Mutable References</a></h3>
<p>We can fix the code from Listing 4-6 to allow us to modify a borrowed value

</code></pre>
<p>This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow <code>s</code> as
mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in <code>r1</code> and must
last until it’s used in the <code>println!</code>, but between the creation of that
mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference
in <code>r2</code> that borrows the same data as <code>r1</code>.</p>
<p>The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the
same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s something
that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages let you mutate
whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can
prevent data races at compile time. A <em>data race</em> is similar to a race
condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.</li>
<li>At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.</li>
<li>There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix
when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by
refusing to compile code with data races!</p>
<p>As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
multiple mutable references, just not <em>simultaneous</em> ones:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Whew! We <em>also</em> cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one
to the same value.</p>
<p>Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the value to suddenly change out
from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no
one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s
reading of the data.</p>
<p>Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues
through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will
compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the <code>println!</code>,
occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let r1 = &amp;s; // no problem
    let r2 = &amp;s; // no problem
    println!(&quot;{} and {}&quot;, r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &amp;mut s; // no problem
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, r3);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The scopes of the immutable references <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> end after the <code>println!</code>
where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference <code>r3</code> is
created. These scopes don’t overlap, so this code is allowed: the compiler can
tell that the reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of
the scope.</p>
<p>Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s
the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather
than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don’t
have to track down why your data isn’t what you thought it was.</p>
<h3 id="dangling-references"><a class="header" href="#dangling-references">Dangling References</a></h3>
<p>In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a <em>dangling
pointer</em>—a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been
given to someone else—by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that
memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will
never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the
compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the
reference to the data does.</p>

<p>This error message refers to a feature we haven’t covered yet: lifetimes. We’ll

<pre><code class="language-text">this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value

<p>Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our

<p>Because <code>s</code> is created inside <code>dangle</code>, when the code of <code>dangle</code> is finished,

<p>Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> one mutable reference <em>or</em> any
number of immutable references.</li>
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-slice-type"><a class="header" href="#the-slice-type">The Slice Type</a></h2>
<p><em>Slices</em> let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection
rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does
not have ownership.</p>
<p>Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string of
words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string.
If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be
one word, so the entire string should be returned.</p>
<p>Let’s work through how we’d write the signature of this function without using
slices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; ?
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>first_word</code> function has a <code>&amp;String</code> as a parameter. We don’t want
ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a
way to talk about <em>part</em> of a string. However, we could return the index of the
end of the word, indicated by a space. Let’s try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {

<p>We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in <a href="ch13-02-iterators.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->.
For now, know that <code>iter</code> is a method that returns each element in a collection
and that <code>enumerate</code> wraps the result of <code>iter</code> and returns each element as
part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from
<code>enumerate</code> is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element.
This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.</p>
<p>Because the <code>enumerate</code> method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to
destructure that tuple. We’ll be discussing patterns more in <a href="ch06-02-match.html#patterns-that-bind-to-values">Chapter
6</a><!-- ignore -->. In the <code>for</code> loop, we specify a pattern that has <code>i</code>
for the index in the tuple and <code>&amp;item</code> for the single byte in the tuple.
Because we get a reference to the element from <code>.iter().enumerate()</code>, we use
<code>&amp;</code> in the pattern.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>for</code> loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by
using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position.
Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using <code>s.len()</code>.</p>

only a meaningful number in the context of the <code>&amp;String</code>. In other words,
because it’s a separate value from the <code>String</code>, there’s no guarantee that it
will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that

<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-8: Storing the result from calling the
<code>first_word</code> function and then changing the <code>String</code> contents</span></p>
<p>This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used <code>word</code>
after calling <code>s.clear()</code>. Because <code>word</code> isn’t connected to the state of <code>s</code>
at all, <code>word</code> still contains the value <code>5</code>. We could use that value <code>5</code> with
the variable <code>s</code> to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug
because the contents of <code>s</code> have changed since we saved <code>5</code> in <code>word</code>.</p>
<p>Having to worry about the index in <code>word</code> getting out of sync with the data in
<code>s</code> is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if
we write a <code>second_word</code> function. Its signature would have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; (usize, usize) {
</code></pre>
<p>Now we’re tracking a starting <em>and</em> an ending index, and we have even more
values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to
that state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need
to be kept in sync.</p>
<p>Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-slices">String Slices</a></h3>
<p>A <em>string slice</em> is a reference to part of a <code>String</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let hello = &amp;s[0..5];
    let world = &amp;s[6..11];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Rather than a reference to the entire <code>String</code>, <code>hello</code> is a reference to a
portion of the <code>String</code>, specified in the extra <code>[0..5]</code> bit. We create slices
using a range within brackets by specifying <code>[starting_index..ending_index]</code>,
where <code>starting_index</code> is the first position in the slice and <code>ending_index</code> is
one more than the last position in the slice. Internally, the slice data
structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which
corresponds to <code>ending_index</code> minus <code>starting_index</code>. So, in the case of <code>let world = &amp;s[6..11];</code>, <code>world</code> would be a slice that contains a pointer to the
byte at index 6 of <code>s</code> with a length value of <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="Three tables: a table representing the stack data of s, which points
to the byte at index 0 in a table of the string data &quot;hello world&quot; on
the heap. The third table rep-resents the stack data of the slice world, which
has a length value of 5 and points to byte 6 of the heap data table."

<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a
<code>String</code></span></p>
<p>With Rust’s <code>..</code> range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can drop
the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let slice = &amp;s[0..2];
let slice = &amp;s[..2];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the <code>String</code>, you
can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[3..len];
let slice = &amp;s[3..];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these
are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[0..len];
let slice = &amp;s[..];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character
boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes
of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a
more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings">“Storing UTF-8 Encoded
Text with Strings”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite <code>first_word</code> to return a
slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as <code>&amp;str</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &amp;s[..]
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing 4-7, by
looking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we return a
string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space as the
starting and ending indices.</p>
<p>Now when we call <code>first_word</code>, we get back a single value that is tied to the
underlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of
the slice and the number of elements in the slice.</p>
<p>Returning a slice would also work for a <code>second_word</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up because the
compiler will ensure the references into the <code>String</code> remain valid. Remember
the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the
first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was
logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The problems would
show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied
string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with
our code much sooner. Using the slice version of <code>first_word</code> will throw a
compile-time error:</p>

error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to
something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because <code>clear</code> needs to
truncate the <code>String</code>, it needs to get a mutable reference. The <code>println!</code>
after the call to <code>clear</code> uses the reference in <code>word</code>, so the immutable
reference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable
reference in <code>clear</code> and the immutable reference in <code>word</code> from existing at the
same time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use,
but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!</p>

<h4 id="string-literals-as-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-literals-as-slices">String Literals as Slices</a></h4>
<p>Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now
that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:</p>

</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The type of <code>s</code> here is <code>&amp;str</code>: it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of
the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; <code>&amp;str</code> is an
immutable reference.</p>
<h4 id="string-slices-as-parameters"><a class="header" href="#string-slices-as-parameters">String Slices as Parameters</a></h4>
<p>Knowing that you can take slices of literals and <code>String</code> values leads us to
one more improvement on <code>first_word</code>, and that’s its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {

<p>A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9

<h3 id="other-slices"><a class="header" href="#other-slices">Other Slices</a></h3>
<p>String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a
more general slice type too. Consider this array:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Just as we might want to refer to part of a string, we might want to refer to
part of an array. We’d do so like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &amp;a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &amp;[2, 3]);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This slice has the type <code>&amp;[i32]</code>. It works the same way as string slices do, by
storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of
slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in
detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust
programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory
usage in the same way as other systems programming languages, but having the
owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope
means you don’t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.</p>
<p>Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we’ll talk about
these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let’s move on to
Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>struct</em>, or <em>structure</em>, is a custom data type that lets you package
together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If
you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a <em>struct</em> is like an
object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples
with structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs are
a better way to group data.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to
define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions called
<em>methods</em>, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums
(discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your
program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Structs are similar to tuples, but with named fields, making them more flexible than tuples.</li>
<li>To define a struct, use the struct keyword followed by the name of the struct and the names and types of its fields inside curly brackets.</li>
<li>To create an instance of a struct, specify concrete values for each field using key: value pairs inside curly brackets.</li>
<li>To access a specific value from a struct, use dot notation.</li>
<li>To change a value in a mutable struct, use dot notation and assign a new value to the field.</li>
<li>Struct update syntax can be used to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance but changes some.</li>
<li>Tuple structs are similar to tuples, but with a name that makes them a different type from other tuples.</li>
<li>Unit-like structs don’t have any fields and can be useful when implementing a trait on a type without any data to store.</li>

</details>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples, discussed in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!--
ignore --> section, in that both hold multiple related values. Like tuples, the
pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct
you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. Adding these
names means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely
on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p>
<p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A
struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being
grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of
the pieces of data, which we call <em>fields</em>. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a
struct that stores information about a user account.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-1: A <code>User</code> struct definition</span></p>
<p>To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an <em>instance</em> of that struct
by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by
stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing <code>key: value</code> pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the
data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in
the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the
struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill
in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">struct User {
</span><span class="boring">    active: bool,

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the <code>User</code>
struct</span></p>
<p>To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to
access this user’s email address, we use <code>user1.email</code>. If the instance is
mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a
particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the <code>email</code>
field of a mutable <code>User</code> instance.</p>

implicitly return that new instance.</p>

<em>struct update syntax</em>.</p>
<p>First, in Listing 5-6 we show how to create a new <code>User</code> instance in <code>user2</code>

<p>Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new
<code>email</code> value for a <code>User</code> instance but use the rest of the values from
<code>user1</code></span></p>
<p>The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in <code>user2</code> that has a
different value for <code>email</code> but has the same values for the <code>username</code>,
<code>active</code>, and <code>sign_in_count</code> fields from <code>user1</code>. The <code>..user1</code> must come last
to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the
corresponding fields in <code>user1</code>, but we can choose to specify values for as
many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in
the struct’s definition.</p>
<p>Note that the struct update syntax uses <code>=</code> like an assignment; this is
because it moves the data, just as we saw in the <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-move">“Ways Variables and Data
Interact: Move”</a><!-- ignore --> section. In this example, we can no
longer use <code>user1</code> after creating <code>user2</code> because the <code>String</code> in the
<code>username</code> field of <code>user1</code> was moved into <code>user2</code>. If we had given <code>user2</code> new
<code>String</code> values for both <code>email</code> and <code>username</code>, and thus only used the
<code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> values from <code>user1</code>, then <code>user1</code> would still be
valid after creating <code>user2</code>. The types of <code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> are
types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, so the behavior we discussed in the
<a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy">“Stack-Only Data: Copy”</a><!-- ignore --> section would apply.</p>
<h3 id="using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types"><a class="header" href="#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types</a></h3>
<p>Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called <em>tuple
structs</em>. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but
don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types
of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a
name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each
field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p>
<p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name
followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use
two tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types, because they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For
example, a function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a
<code>Point</code> as an argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code>
values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can
destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a <code>.</code> followed
by the index to access an individual value.</p>
<h3 id="unit-like-structs-without-any-fields"><a class="header" href="#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields">Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields</a></h3>
<p>You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called
<em>unit-like structs</em> because they behave similarly to <code>()</code>, the unit type that
we mentioned in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section. Unit-like
structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t
have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits
in Chapter 10. Here’s an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct
named <code>AlwaysEqual</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>To define <code>AlwaysEqual</code>, we use the <code>struct</code> keyword, the name we want, then a
semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses! Then we can get an
instance of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> in the <code>subject</code> variable in a similar way: using the
name we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that later
we’ll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of
<code>AlwaysEqual</code> is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to
have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn’t need any data to
implement that behavior! You’ll see in Chapter 10 how to define traits and
implement them on any type, including unit-like structs.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership-of-struct-data"><a class="header" href="#ownership-of-struct-data">Ownership of Struct Data</a></h3>
<p>In the <code>User</code> struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned <code>String</code>
type rather than the <code>&amp;str</code> string slice type. This is a deliberate choice
because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for
that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.</p>
<p>It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something
else, but to do so requires the use of <em>lifetimes</em>, a Rust feature that we’ll
discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct
is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference
in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like the following; this won’t work:</p>

<p>To understand when we might want to use structs, let’s write a program that

then refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new binary project with Cargo called <em>rectangles</em> that will take
the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area
of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
exactly that in our project’s <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

</code></pre>
<p>This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the
<code>area</code> function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code clear
and readable.</p>
<p>The issue with this code is evident in the signature of <code>area</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>area</code> function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the

manageable to group width and height together. We’ve already discussed one way
we might do that in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3: by using tuples.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-tuples"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-tuples">Refactoring with Tuples</a></h3>

<p>In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and
we’re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less
clear: tuples don’t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of
the tuple, making our calculation less obvious.</p>
<p>Mixing up the width and height wouldn’t matter for the area calculation, but if
we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have to
keep in mind that <code>width</code> is the tuple index <code>0</code> and <code>height</code> is the tuple
index <code>1</code>. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in
mind if they were to use our code. Because we haven’t conveyed the meaning of
our data in our code, it’s now easier to introduce errors.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning">Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning</a></h3>
<p>We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple
we’re using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as names for the
parts, as shown in Listing 5-10.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,

        width: 30,
        height: 50,

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-10: Defining a <code>Rectangle</code> struct</span></p>
<p>Here we’ve defined a struct and named it <code>Rectangle</code>. Inside the curly
brackets, we defined the fields as <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, both of which have
type <code>u32</code>. Then in <code>main</code>, we created a particular instance of <code>Rectangle</code>
that has a width of 30 and a height of 50.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is now defined with one parameter, which we’ve named
<code>rectangle</code>, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct <code>Rectangle</code>
instance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than
take ownership of it. This way, <code>main</code> retains its ownership and can continue
using <code>rect1</code>, which is the reason we use the <code>&amp;</code> in the function signature and
where we call the function.</p>
<p>The <code>area</code> function accesses the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields of the <code>Rectangle</code>
instance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance does not
move the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs). Our
function signature for <code>area</code> now says exactly what we mean: calculate the area
of <code>Rectangle</code>, using its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields. This conveys that the
width and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to
the values rather than using the tuple index values of <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. This is a
win for clarity.</p>

<p>The <code>println!</code> macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly
brackets tell <code>println!</code> to use formatting known as <code>Display</code>: output intended
for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we’ve seen so far
implement <code>Display</code> by default, because there’s only one way you’d want to show
a <code>1</code> or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way
<code>println!</code> should format the output is less clear because there are more
display possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the
curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust
doesn’t try to guess what we want, and structs don’t have a provided
implementation of <code>Display</code> to use with <code>println!</code> and the <code>{}</code> placeholder.</p>
<p>If we continue reading the errors, we’ll find this helpful note:</p>

<p>Let’s try it! The <code>println!</code> macro call will now look like <code>println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);</code>. Putting the specifier <code>:?</code> inside the curly brackets tells
<code>println!</code> we want to use an output format called <code>Debug</code>. The <code>Debug</code> trait
enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can
see its value while we’re debugging our code.</p>
<p>Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:</p>

<p>Rust <em>does</em> include functionality to print out debugging information, but we

<p>Nice! It’s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields

larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in
those cases, we can use <code>{:#?}</code> instead of <code>{:?}</code> in the <code>println!</code> string.
In this example, using the <code>{:#?}</code> style will output:</p>

<p>Here’s an example where we’re interested in the value that gets assigned to the
<code>width</code> field, as well as the value of the whole struct in <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&amp;rect1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We can put <code>dbg!</code> around the expression <code>30 * scale</code> and, because <code>dbg!</code>
returns ownership of the expression’s value, the <code>width</code> field will get the
same value as if we didn’t have the <code>dbg!</code> call there. We don’t want <code>dbg!</code> to
take ownership of <code>rect1</code>, so we use a reference to <code>rect1</code> in the next call.
Here’s what the output of this example looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[src/main.rs:10] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:14] &amp;rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the first bit of output came from <em>src/main.rs</em> line 10, where we’re
debugging the expression <code>30 * scale</code>, and its resulting value is 60 (the
<code>Debug</code> formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The
<code>dbg!</code> call on line 14 of <em>src/main.rs</em> outputs the value of <code>&amp;rect1</code>, which is
the <code>Rectangle</code> struct. This output uses the pretty <code>Debug</code> formatting of the
<code>Rectangle</code> type. The <code>dbg!</code> macro can be really helpful when you’re trying to
figure out what your code is doing!</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>Debug</code> trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us
to use with the <code>derive</code> attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom
types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">Appendix C</a><!--
ignore -->. We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as
well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many
attributes other than <code>derive</code>; for more information, see <a href="../reference/attributes.html">the “Attributes”
section of the Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is very specific: it only computes the area of rectangles.
It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our <code>Rectangle</code>
struct, because it won’t work with any other type. Let’s look at how we can
continue to refactor this code by turning the <code>area</code> function into an <code>area</code>
<em>method</em> defined on our <code>Rectangle</code> type.</p>

<li>Everything within this <code>impl</code> block
will be associated with the <code>Rectangle</code> type.</li>

within the <code>impl</code> curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only)
parameter to be <code>self</code> in the signature and everywhere within the body.</li>
<li>In <code>main</code>, where we called the <code>area</code> function and passed <code>rect1</code> as an argument,</li>
<li>we can instead use <em>method syntax</em> to call the <code>area</code> method on our <code>Rectangle</code>
instance.</li>
<li>The method syntax <strong>goes after an instance</strong>: we add a dot followed by
the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.</li>

<li>Instead:
In the signature for <code>area</code>, we use <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>&amp;self</code> is actually short for <code>self: &amp;Self</code>.</li>
<li>Within an <code>impl</code> block, the
type <code>Self</code> is an alias for the type that the <code>impl</code> block is for, just like class in python.</li>

have a parameter named <code>self</code> of type <code>Self</code> for their first parameter, so Rust
lets you abbreviate this with only the name <code>self</code> in the first parameter spot.</li>

<p>Note that we still need to use the <code>&amp;</code> in front of the <code>self</code> shorthand to

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, but not always, when we give methods with the same name as a field we
want it to only return the value in the field and do nothing else. Methods like
this are called <em>getters</em>, and Rust does not implement them automatically for
struct fields as some other languages do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getters are useful because you can
make the field private but the method public and thus enable read-only access
to that field as part of the type’s public API. We will be discussing what
public and private are and how to designate a field or method as public or
private in Chapter 7.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the---operator"><a class="header" href="#wheres-the---operator">Where’s the <em>-&gt;</em> Operator?</a></h2>
<p>In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>you use <code>.</code> if you’re calling a method on the object directly</li>
<li>and <code>-&gt;</code> if you’re
calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the
pointer first.</li>
<li>In other words, if <code>object</code> is a pointer,
<code>object-&gt;something()</code> is similar to <code>(*object).something()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the <code>-&gt;</code> operator; instead, Rust has a
feature called <em>automatic referencing and dereferencing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling methods is
one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you call a method with <code>object.something()</code>, Rust
automatically adds in <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, or <code>*</code> so <code>object</code> matches the signature of
the method.</li>

<p>The first one looks much cleaner:</p>
<ul>
<li>This automatic referencing behavior works
because methods have a clear receiver—the type of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>Given the receiver
and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
reading (<code>&amp;self</code>), mutating (<code>&amp;mut self</code>), or consuming (<code>self</code>).</li>
<li>The fact
that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of
making ownership ergonomic in practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="methods-with-more-parameters"><a class="header" href="#methods-with-more-parameters">Methods with More Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Let’s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the <code>Rectangle</code>
struct.</p>
<p>This time, we want an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> to take another instance
of <code>Rectangle</code> and return <code>true</code> if the second <code>Rectangle</code> can fit completely
within <code>self</code> (the first <code>Rectangle</code>);</p>
<p>otherwise it should return <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>That is, once we’ve defined the <code>can_hold</code> method, we want to be able to write the

<ol>
<li>We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the <code>impl Rectangle</code>
block.</li>
<li>The method name will be <code>can_hold</code>, and it will take an immutable borrow
of another <code>Rectangle</code> as a parameter.</li>
<li>We can tell what the type of the
parameter will be by looking at the code that calls the method:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2)</code> passes in <code>&amp;rect2</code>, which is <strong>an immutable borrow</strong> to
<code>rect2</code>, an instance of <code>Rectangle</code>.</li>
<li>This makes sense because we only need to
read <code>rect2</code> (rather than write, which would mean we’d need a mutable borrow),
and we want <code>main</code> to retain ownership of <code>rect2</code> so we can use it again after
calling the <code>can_hold</code> method.</li>
<li>The return value of <code>can_hold</code> will be a
Boolean, and the implementation will check whether the width and height of
<code>self</code> are both greater than the width and height of the other <code>Rectangle</code>,
respectively.</li>

<p>There’s no reason to separate these methods into multiple <code>impl</code> blocks here,
but this is valid syntax.</p>
<p>We’ll see a case in which multiple <code>impl</code> blocks are
useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.</p>
<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other
and name each piece to make your code clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>impl</code> blocks, you can define
<strong>functions that are associated with your type</strong>, and <strong>methods are a kind of
associated function</strong> that let you specify the behavior that instances of your
structs have.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>But structs aren’t the only way you can create custom types: let’s turn to
Rust’s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="enums-and-pattern-matching"><a class="header" href="#enums-and-pattern-matching">Enums and Pattern Matching</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we’ll look at <em>enumerations</em>, also referred to as <em>enums</em>.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible <em>variants</em>. First,
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the <code>if let</code>
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in
your code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="defining-an-enum"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-enum">Defining an Enum</a></h2>
<p>Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like
a <code>Rectangle</code> with its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, enums give you a way of saying a
value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that
<code>Rectangle</code> is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes <code>Circle</code> and
<code>Triangle</code>. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums
are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work
with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an
IP address that our program will come across, we can <em>enumerate</em> all possible
variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p>
<p>Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not
both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate, because an enum value can only be one of its variants.
Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP
addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling
situations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p>
<p>We can express this concept in code by defining an <code>IpAddrKind</code> enumeration and
listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. These are the
variants of the enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
</span><span class="boring">    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>IpAddrKind</code> is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.</p>
<h3 id="enum-values"><a class="header" href="#enum-values">Enum Values</a></h3>
<p>We can create instances of each of the two variants of <code>IpAddrKind</code> like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we
use a double colon to separate the two. This is useful because now both values
<code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> and <code>IpAddrKind::V6</code> are of the same type: <code>IpAddrKind</code>. We
can then, for instance, define a function that takes any <code>IpAddrKind</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
</span><span class="boring">    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>And we can call this function with either variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
</span><span class="boring">    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
<span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,
at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address <em>data</em>; we
only know what <em>kind</em> it is. Given that you just learned about structs in
Chapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown in
Listing 6-1.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }

    struct IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind,
        address: String,
    }

    let home = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
        address: String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;),
    };

    let loopback = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
        address: String::from(&quot;::1&quot;),
    };
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-1: Storing the data and <code>IpAddrKind</code> variant of
an IP address using a <code>struct</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’ve defined a struct <code>IpAddr</code> that has two fields: a <code>kind</code> field that
is of type <code>IpAddrKind</code> (the enum we defined previously) and an <code>address</code> field
of type <code>String</code>. We have two instances of this struct. The first is <code>home</code>,
and it has the value <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> as its <code>kind</code> with associated address
data of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The second instance is <code>loopback</code>. It has the other
variant of <code>IpAddrKind</code> as its <code>kind</code> value, <code>V6</code>, and has address <code>::1</code>
associated with it. We’ve used a struct to bundle the <code>kind</code> and <code>address</code>
values together, so now the variant is associated with the value.</p>
<p>However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise:
rather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into each enum
variant. This new definition of the <code>IpAddr</code> enum says that both <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>
variants will have associated <code>String</code> values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddr {
        V4(String),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;));

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an
extra struct. Here it’s also easier to see another detail of how enums work:
the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that
constructs an instance of the enum. That is, <code>IpAddr::V4()</code> is a function call
that takes a <code>String</code> argument and returns an instance of the <code>IpAddr</code> type. We
automatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining the
enum.</p>
<p>There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant
can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four type IP
addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values
between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but
still express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we wouldn’t be able to with
a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version
four and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store
IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that <a href="../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html">the standard
library has a definition we can use!</a><!-- ignore --> Let’s look at how
the standard library defines <code>IpAddr</code>: it has the exact enum and variants that
we’ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in
the form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each
variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant:
strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another
enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than
what you might come up with.</p>
<p>Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for <code>IpAddr</code>,
we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we
haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope. We’ll talk
more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide
variety of types embedded in its variants.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-2: A <code>Message</code> enum whose variants each store
different amounts and types of values</span></p>
<p>This enum has four variants with different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Quit</code> has no data associated with it at all.</li>
<li><code>Move</code> has named fields like a struct does.</li>
<li><code>Write</code> includes a single <code>String</code>.</li>
<li><code>ChangeColor</code> includes three <code>i32</code> values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to
defining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn’t use the
<code>struct</code> keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the <code>Message</code>
type. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum
variants hold:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But if we used the different structs, which each have their own type, we
couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as
we could with the <code>Message</code> enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.</p>
<p>There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to
define methods on structs using <code>impl</code>, we’re also able to define methods on
enums. Here’s a method named <code>call</code> that we could define on our <code>Message</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    enum Message {
</span><span class="boring">        Quit,
</span><span class="boring">        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
</span><span class="boring">        Write(String),
</span><span class="boring">        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    impl Message {
        fn call(&amp;self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;));
    m.call();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The body of the method would use <code>self</code> to get the value that we called the
method on. In this example, we’ve created a variable <code>m</code> that has the value
<code>Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;))</code>, and that is what <code>self</code> will be in the
body of the <code>call</code> method when <code>m.call()</code> runs.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and
useful: <code>Option</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values"><a class="header" href="#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values">The <code>Option</code> Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values</a></h3>
<p>This section explores a case study of <code>Option</code>, which is another enum defined
by the standard library. The <code>Option</code> type encodes the very common scenario in
which a value could be something or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>For example, if you request the first of a list containing items, you would get
a value. If you request the first item of an empty list, you would get nothing.
Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can
check whether you’ve handled all the cases you should be handling; this
functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming
languages.</p>
<p>Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you
include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the
null feature that many other languages have. <em>Null</em> is a value that means there
is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of
two states: null or not-null.</p>
<p>In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony
Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the
temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
the last forty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a
not-null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null
property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.</p>
<p>However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a
null is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t really with the concept but with the particular
implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum
that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it is <a href="../std/option/enum.Option.html">defined by the standard library</a><!-- ignore -->
as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you
don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included in
the prelude: you can use <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> directly without the <code>Option::</code>
prefix. The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is still just a regular enum, and <code>Some(T)</code> and
<code>None</code> are still variants of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a
generic type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.
For now, all you need to know is that <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> means the <code>Some</code> variant of the
<code>Option</code> enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each concrete
type that gets used in place of <code>T</code> makes the overall <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type a
different type. Here are some examples of using <code>Option</code> values to hold number
types and string types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_char = Some('e');

    let absent_number: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The type of <code>some_number</code> is <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>. The type of <code>some_char</code> is
<code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code>, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because
we’ve specified a value inside the <code>Some</code> variant. For <code>absent_number</code>, Rust
requires us to annotate the overall <code>Option</code> type: the compiler can’t infer the
type that the corresponding <code>Some</code> variant will hold by looking only at a
<code>None</code> value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for <code>absent_number</code> to be of type
<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When we have a <code>Some</code> value, we know that a value is present and the value is
held within the <code>Some</code>. When we have a <code>None</code> value, in some sense, it means
the same thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> any better than having null?</p>
<p>In short, because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> can be any type) are different
types, the compiler won’t let us use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value as if it were
definitely a valid value. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s
trying to add an <code>i8</code> to an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option&lt;i8&gt; = Some(5);

    let sum = x + y;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we run this code, we get an error message like this:</p>

error: could not compile `enums` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how
to add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>, because they’re different types. When we
have a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we
always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check
for null before using that value. Only when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code> (or
whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly
not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before
using the value.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to convert an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>T</code> before you can
perform <code>T</code> operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most
common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually
is.</p>
<p>Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be
more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be
null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case
when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you <em>can</em> safely assume that the value isn’t null. This was a
deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase
the safety of Rust code.</p>
<p>So, how do you get the <code>T</code> value out of a <code>Some</code> variant when you have a value
of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> so you can use that value? The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a large
number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check
them out in <a href="../std/option/enum.Option.html">its documentation</a><!-- ignore -->. Becoming familiar with
the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.</p>
<p>In general, in order to use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value, you want to have code that
will handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have a
<code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. You want some
other code to run if you have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn’t have a <code>T</code>
value available. The <code>match</code> expression is a control flow construct that does
just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which
variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching
value.</p>

<h2 id="the-match-control-flow-construct"><a class="header" href="#the-match-control-flow-construct">The <code>match</code> Control Flow Construct</a></h2>
<p>Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called <code>match</code> that allows
you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based
on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable
names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different
kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of <code>match</code> comes from the
expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all
possible cases are handled.</p>
<p>Think of a <code>match</code> expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide
down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through
the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go
through each pattern in a <code>match</code>, and at the first pattern the value “fits,”
the value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.</p>
<p>Speaking of coins, let’s use them as an example using <code>match</code>! We can write a
function that takes an unknown United States coin and, in a similar way as the
counting machine, determines which coin it is and returns its value in cents, as
shown here in Listing 6-3.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-3: An enum and a <code>match</code> expression that has
the variants of the enum as its patterns</span></p>
<p>Let’s break down the <code>match</code> in the <code>value_in_cents</code> function. First, we list
the <code>match</code> keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value
<code>coin</code>. This seems very similar to an expression used with <code>if</code>, but there’s a
big difference: with <code>if</code>, the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but
here, it can return any type. The type of <code>coin</code> in this example is the <code>Coin</code>
enum that we defined on the first line.</p>
<p>Next are the <code>match</code> arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The
first arm here has a pattern that is the value <code>Coin::Penny</code> and then the <code>=&gt;</code>
operator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case
is just the value <code>1</code>. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.</p>
<p>When the <code>match</code> expression executes, it compares the resulting value against
the pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code
associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the
value, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.
We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our <code>match</code> has four arms.</p>
<p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resulting value of
the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the
entire <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>We don’t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is
in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple
lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma
following the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints
“Lucky penny!” every time the method is called with a <code>Coin::Penny</code>, but still
returns the last value of the block, <code>1</code>:</p>

<h3 id="patterns-that-bind-to-values"><a class="header" href="#patterns-that-bind-to-values">Patterns that Bind to Values</a></h3>
<p>Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the
values that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum
variants.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.
From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different
designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state
designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to
our <code>enum</code> by changing the <code>Quarter</code> variant to include a <code>UsState</code> value stored
inside it, which we’ve done here in Listing 6-4.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-4: A <code>Coin</code> enum in which the <code>Quarter</code> variant
also holds a <code>UsState</code> value</span></p>
<p>Let’s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While
we sort our loose change by coin type, we’ll also call out the name of the
state associated with each quarter so if it’s one our friend doesn’t have, they
can add it to their collection.</p>
<p>In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called <code>state</code> to the
pattern that matches values of the variant <code>Coin::Quarter</code>. When a
<code>Coin::Quarter</code> matches, the <code>state</code> variable will bind to the value of that
quarter’s state. Then we can use <code>state</code> in the code for that arm, like so:</p>

<p>If we were to call <code>value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))</code>, <code>coin</code>
would be <code>Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)</code>. When we compare that value with each
of the match arms, none of them match until we reach <code>Coin::Quarter(state)</code>. At
that point, the binding for <code>state</code> will be the value <code>UsState::Alaska</code>. We can
then use that binding in the <code>println!</code> expression, thus getting the inner
state value out of the <code>Coin</code> enum variant for <code>Quarter</code>.</p>
<h3 id="matching-with-optiont"><a class="header" href="#matching-with-optiont">Matching with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner <code>T</code> value out of the <code>Some</code>
case when using <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can also handle <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>match</code> as we
did with the <code>Coin</code> enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the
variants of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but the way that the <code>match</code> expression works remains
the same.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to write a function that takes an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> and, if
there’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside,
the function should return the <code>None</code> value and not attempt to perform any
operations.</p>
<p>This function is very easy to write, thanks to <code>match</code>, and will look like
Listing 6-5.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

            Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),

<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-5: A function that uses a <code>match</code> expression on

<p>Let’s examine the first execution of <code>plus_one</code> in more detail. When we call
<code>plus_one(five)</code>, the variable <code>x</code> in the body of <code>plus_one</code> will have the
value <code>Some(5)</code>. We then compare that against each match arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>The <code>Some(5)</code> value doesn’t match the pattern <code>None</code>, so we continue to the
next arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

</span></code></pre>
<p>Does <code>Some(5)</code> match <code>Some(i)</code>? Why yes it does! We have the same variant. The
<code>i</code> binds to the value contained in <code>Some</code>, so <code>i</code> takes the value <code>5</code>. The
code in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of <code>i</code> and
create a new <code>Some</code> value with our total <code>6</code> inside.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the second call of <code>plus_one</code> in Listing 6-5, where <code>x</code> is
<code>None</code>. We enter the <code>match</code> and compare to the first arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

</span><span class="boring">    let none = plus_one(None);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>It matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the
<code>None</code> value on the right side of <code>=&gt;</code>. Because the first arm matched, no other
arms are compared.</p>
<p>Combining <code>match</code> and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this
pattern a lot in Rust code: <code>match</code> against an enum, bind a variable to the
data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first, but
once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s
consistently a user favorite.</p>
<h3 id="matches-are-exhaustive"><a class="header" href="#matches-are-exhaustive">Matches Are Exhaustive</a></h3>
<p>There’s one other aspect of <code>match</code> we need to discuss: the arms’ patterns must
cover all possibilities. Consider this version of our <code>plus_one</code> function,
which has a bug and won’t compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

<p>We didn’t handle the <code>None</code> case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:</p>

<p>Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are <em>exhaustive</em>: we must exhaust every last
possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
<code>None</code> case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.</p>
<h3 id="catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder"><a class="header" href="#catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder">Catch-all Patterns and the <code>_</code> Placeholder</a></h3>
<p>Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but
for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game
where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move, but instead
gets a new fancy hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all
other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s
a <code>match</code> that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll
hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by
functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for
this example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        other =&gt; move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values 3 and 7. For the
last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the variable
we’ve chosen to name <code>other</code>. The code that runs for the <code>other</code> arm uses the
variable by passing it to the <code>move_player</code> function.</p>
<p>This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a
<code>u8</code> can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically
listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that <code>match</code> must be
exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the
patterns are evaluated in order. If we put the catch-all arm earlier, the other
arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all!</p>
<p>Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don’t want to
<em>use</em> the value in the catch-all pattern: <code>_</code> is a special pattern that matches
any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to
use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.</p>
<p>Let’s change the rules of the game: now, if you roll anything other than a 3 or
a 7, you must roll again. We no longer need to use the catch-all value, so we
can change our code to use <code>_</code> instead of the variable named <code>other</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; reroll(),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re explicitly
ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten anything.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll change the rules of the game one more time, so that nothing else
happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can express
that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple
Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section) as the code that goes with the <code>_</code> arm:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other value
that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run any
code in this case.</p>
<p>There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in <a href="ch18-00-patterns.html">Chapter
18</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, we’re going to move on to the
<code>if let</code> syntax, which can be useful in situations where the <code>match</code> expression
is a bit wordy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="concise-control-flow-with-if-let"><a class="header" href="#concise-control-flow-with-if-let">Concise Control Flow with <code>if let</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the
program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value in the <code>config_max</code>
variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) =&gt; println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {}&quot;, max),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-6: A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing
code when the value is <code>Some</code></span></p>
<p>If the value is <code>Some</code>, we print out the value in the <code>Some</code> variant by binding
the value to the variable <code>max</code> in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything
with the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we have to add <code>_ =&gt; ()</code> after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to
add.</p>
<p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following
code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in Listing 6-6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {}&quot;, max);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The syntax <code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a <code>match</code>, where the expression is given to the
<code>match</code> and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is
<code>Some(max)</code>, and the <code>max</code> binds to the value inside the <code>Some</code>. We can then
use <code>max</code> in the body of the <code>if let</code> block in the same way as we used <code>max</code> in
the corresponding <code>match</code> arm. The code in the <code>if let</code> block isn’t run if the
value doesn’t match the pattern.</p>
<p>Using <code>if let</code> means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking that <code>match</code> enforces. Choosing
between <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> depends on what you’re doing in your particular
situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for
losing exhaustive checking.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.</p>
<p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the
<code>else</code> is the same as the block of code that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the
<code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall the
<code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a
<code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code>
expression like this:</p>

<p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a <code>match</code>, remember that <code>if let</code> is in your Rust toolbox as well.</p>
<h2 id="summary-6"><a class="header" href="#summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.</p>
<p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: the
compiler will make certain your functions get only values of the type each
function expects.</p>
<p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.</p>

<p>As you write large programs, organizing your code will become increasingly
important. By grouping related functionality and separating code with distinct
features, you’ll clarify where to find code that implements a particular
feature and where to go to change how a feature works.</p>
<p>The programs we’ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a
project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules
and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and
optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into
separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all
these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated
packages that evolve together, Cargo provides <em>workspaces</em>, which we’ll cover
in the <a href="ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html">“Cargo Workspaces”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 14.</p>
<p>We’ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse
code at a higher level: once you’ve implemented an operation, other code can
call your code via its public interface without having to know how the
implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public for
other code to use and which parts are private implementation details that you
reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of detail
you have to keep in your head.</p>
<p>A related concept is scope: the nested context in which code is written has a
set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading, writing, and
compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular
name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module,
constant, or other item and what that item means. You can create scopes and
change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two items with the
same name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.</p>
<p>Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s
organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private,
and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes
collectively referred to as the <em>module system</em>, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packages:</strong> A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates</li>
<li><strong>Crates:</strong> A tree of modules that produces a library or executable</li>
<li><strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>use:</strong> Let you control the organization, scope, and
privacy of paths</li>
<li><strong>Paths:</strong> A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover all these features, discuss how they interact, and
explain how to use them to manage scope. By the end, you should have a solid
understanding of the module system and be able to work with scopes like a pro!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="packages-and-crates"><a class="header" href="#packages-and-crates">Packages and Crates</a></h2>
<p>The first parts of the module system we’ll cover are packages and crates.</p>
<p>A <em>crate</em> is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a
time. Even if you run <code>rustc</code> rather than <code>cargo</code> and pass a single source code
file (as we did all the way back in the “Writing and Running a Rust Program”
section of Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates
can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get
compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections.</p>
<p>A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
<em>Binary crates</em> are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run,
such as a command-line program or a server. Each must have a function called
<code>main</code> that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we’ve
created so far have been binary crates.</p>
<p><em>Library crates</em> don’t have a <code>main</code> function, and they don’t compile to an
executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with
multiple projects. For example, the <code>rand</code> crate we used in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number">Chapter
2</a><!-- ignore --> provides functionality that generates random numbers.
Most of the time when Rustaceans say “crate”, they mean library crate, and they
use “crate” interchangeably with the general programming concept of a “library“.</p>
<p>The <em>crate root</em> is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes
up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the
<a href="ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html">“Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy”</a><!-- ignore -->
section).</p>
<p>A <em>package</em> is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of
functionality. A package contains a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that describes how to
build those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary crate
for the command-line tool you’ve been using to build your code. The Cargo
package also contains a library crate that the binary crate depends on. Other
projects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same logic the Cargo
command-line tool uses.</p>
<p>A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one
library crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that’s a
library or binary crate.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the
command <code>cargo new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>After we run <code>cargo new</code>, we use <code>ls</code> to see what Cargo creates. In the project
directory, there’s a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, giving us a package. There’s also a
<em>src</em> directory that contains <em>main.rs</em>. Open <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor,
and note there’s no mention of <em>src/main.rs</em>. Cargo follows a convention that
<em>src/main.rs</em> is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the
package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains
<em>src/lib.rs</em>, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the
package, and <em>src/lib.rs</em> is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files
to <code>rustc</code> to build the library or binary.</p>
<p>Here, we have a package that only contains <em>src/main.rs</em>, meaning it only
contains a binary crate named <code>my-project</code>. If a package contains <em>src/main.rs</em>
and <em>src/lib.rs</em>, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same
name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files
in the <em>src/bin</em> directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy"><a class="header" href="#defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy">Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module system,
namely <em>paths</em> that allow you to name items; the <code>use</code> keyword that brings a
path into scope; and the <code>pub</code> keyword to make items public. We’ll also discuss
the <code>as</code> keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.</p>
<p>First, we’re going to start with a list of rules for easy reference when you’re
organizing your code in the future. Then we’ll explain each of the rules in
detail.</p>
<h3 id="modules-cheat-sheet"><a class="header" href="#modules-cheat-sheet">Modules Cheat Sheet</a></h3>
<p>Here we provide a quick reference on how modules, paths, the <code>use</code> keyword, and
the <code>pub</code> keyword work in the compiler, and how most developers organize their
code. We’ll be going through examples of each of these rules throughout this
chapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules
work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start from the crate root</strong>: When compiling a crate, the compiler first
looks in the crate root file (usually <em>src/lib.rs</em> for a library crate or
<em>src/main.rs</em> for a binary crate) for code to compile.</li>
<li><strong>Declaring modules</strong>: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules;
say, you declare a “garden” module with <code>mod garden;</code>. The compiler will look
for the module’s code in these places:
<ul>
<li>Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following <code>mod garden</code></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/mod.rs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Declaring submodules</strong>: In any file other than the crate root, you can
declare submodules. For example, you might declare <code>mod vegetables;</code> in
<em>src/garden.rs</em>. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the
directory named for the parent module in these places:
<ul>
<li>Inline, directly following <code>mod vegetables</code>, within curly brackets instead
of the semicolon</li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Paths to code in modules</strong>: Once a module is part of your crate, you can
refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long
as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an
<code>Asparagus</code> type in the garden vegetables module would be found at
<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Private vs public</strong>: Code within a module is private from its parent
modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with <code>pub mod</code>
instead of <code>mod</code>. To make items within a public module public as well, use
<code>pub</code> before their declarations.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>use</code> keyword</strong>: Within a scope, the <code>use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to
items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to
<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>, you can create a shortcut with <code>use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;</code> and from then on you only need to
write <code>Asparagus</code> to make use of that type in the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we create a binary crate named <code>backyard</code> that illustrates these rules. The
crate’s directory, also named <code>backyard</code>, contains these files and directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The crate root file in this case is <em>src/main.rs</em>, and it contains:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!(&quot;I'm growing {:?}!&quot;, plant);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pub mod garden;</code> line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in
<em>src/garden.rs</em>, which is:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/garden.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">pub mod vegetables;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>pub mod vegetables;</code> means the code in <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em> is
included too. That code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!</p>
<h3 id="grouping-related-code-in-modules"><a class="header" href="#grouping-related-code-in-modules">Grouping Related Code in Modules</a></h3>
<p><em>Modules</em> let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.
Modules also allow us to control the <em>privacy</em> of items, because code within a
module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details
not available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items
within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend
on them.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s write a library crate that provides the functionality of a
restaurant. We’ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies
empty to concentrate on the organization of the code, rather than the
implementation of a restaurant.</p>
<p>In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as
<em>front of house</em> and others as <em>back of house</em>. Front of house is where
customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take
orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks. Back of house is where the
chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do
administrative work.</p>
<p>To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested
modules. Create a new library named <code>restaurant</code> by running <code>cargo new restaurant --lib</code>; then enter the code in Listing 7-1 into <em>src/lib.rs</em> to
define some modules and function signatures. Here’s the front of house section:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-1: A <code>front_of_house</code> module containing other
modules that then contain functions</span></p>
<p>We define a module with the <code>mod</code> keyword followed by the name of the module
(in this case, <code>front_of_house</code>). The body of the module then goes inside curly
brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the
modules <code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code>. Modules can also hold definitions for other
items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and—as in Listing
7-1—functions.</p>
<p>By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why
they’re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on the
groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier
to find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality
to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.</p>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned that <em>src/main.rs</em> and <em>src/lib.rs</em> are called crate
roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two
files form a module named <code>crate</code> at the root of the crate’s module structure,
known as the <em>module tree</em>.</p>
<p>Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing
7-1</span></p>
<p>This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another; for example,
<code>hosting</code> nests inside <code>front_of_house</code>. The tree also shows that some modules
are <em>siblings</em> to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module;
<code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code> are siblings defined within <code>front_of_house</code>. If module
A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the <em>child</em> of module B
and that module B is the <em>parent</em> of module A. Notice that the entire module
tree is rooted under the implicit module named <code>crate</code>.</p>
<p>The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your
computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem,
you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we
need a way to find our modules.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree"><a class="header" href="#paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree">Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree</a></h2>
<p>To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same
way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to
know its path.</p>
<p>A path can take two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>absolute path</em> is the full path starting from a crate root; for code
from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for
code from the current crate, it starts with the literal <code>crate</code>.</li>
<li>A <em>relative path</em> starts from the current module and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or
an identifier in the current module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers
separated by double colons (<code>::</code>).</p>
<p>Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function.
This is the same as asking: what’s the path of the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function?
Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions
removed.</p>
<p>We’ll show two ways to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function from a new function
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but
there’s another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling
as-is. We’ll explain why in a bit.</p>
<p>The <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is part of our library crate’s public API, so
we mark it with the <code>pub</code> keyword. In the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword">“Exposing Paths with the <code>pub</code>
Keyword”</a><!-- ignore --> section, we’ll go into more detail about <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-3: Calling the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using
absolute and relative paths</span></p>
<p>The first time we call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>,
we use an absolute path. The <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is defined in the same
crate as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, which means we can use the <code>crate</code> keyword to
start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we
make our way to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>. You can imagine a filesystem with the same
structure: we’d specify the path <code>/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code> to
run the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> program; using the <code>crate</code> name to start from the
crate root is like using <code>/</code> to start from the filesystem root in your shell.</p>
<p>The second time we call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use a
relative path. The path starts with <code>front_of_house</code>, the name of the module
defined at the same level of the module tree as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Here the
filesystem equivalent would be using the path
<code>front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code>. Starting with a module name means
that the path is relative.</p>
<p>Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make
based on your project, and depends on whether you’re more likely to move item
definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item.
For example, if we move the <code>front_of_house</code> module and the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>
function into a module named <code>customer_experience</code>, we’d need to update the
absolute path to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>, but the relative path would still be valid.
However, if we moved the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function separately into a module
named <code>dining</code>, the absolute path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> call would stay the
same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference in general
is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely we’ll want to move code
definitions and item calls independently of each other.</p>
<p>Let’s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won’t compile yet! The
error we get is shown in Listing 7-4.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in
Listing 7-3</span></p>
<p>The error messages say that module <code>hosting</code> is private. In other words, we
have the correct paths for the <code>hosting</code> module and the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
function, but Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the
private sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums,
modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want
to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.</p>
<p>Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but
items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is
because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child
modules can see the context in which they’re defined. To continue with our
metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a
restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but
office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.</p>
<p>Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner
implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the
inner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give
you the option to expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor
modules by using the <code>pub</code> keyword to make an item public.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in
Listing 7-5</span></p>
<p>What happened? Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword in front of <code>mod hosting</code> makes the
module public. With this change, if we can access <code>front_of_house</code>, we can
access <code>hosting</code>. But the <em>contents</em> of <code>hosting</code> are still private; making the
module public doesn’t make its contents public. The <code>pub</code> keyword on a module
only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.
Because modules are containers, there’s not much we can do by only making the
module public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the
items within the module public as well.</p>
<p>The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is private.
The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as
modules.</p>
<p>Let’s also make the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function public by adding the <code>pub</code>
keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-7: Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword to <code>mod hosting</code>
and <code>fn add_to_waitlist</code> lets us call the function from
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code></span></p>
<p>Now the code will compile! To see why adding the <code>pub</code> keyword lets us use
these paths in <code>add_to_waitlist</code> with respect to the privacy rules, let’s look
at the absolute and the relative paths.</p>
<p>In the absolute path, we start with <code>crate</code>, the root of our crate’s module
tree. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined in the crate root. While
<code>front_of_house</code> isn’t public, because the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is
defined in the same module as <code>front_of_house</code> (that is, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>
and <code>front_of_house</code> are siblings), we can refer to <code>front_of_house</code> from
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Next is the <code>hosting</code> module marked with <code>pub</code>. We can
access the parent module of <code>hosting</code>, so we can access <code>hosting</code>. Finally, the
<code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is marked with <code>pub</code> and we can access its parent
module, so this function call works!</p>
<p>In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the
first step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from
<code>front_of_house</code>. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined within the same module
as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, so the relative path starting from the module in which
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> is defined works. Then, because <code>hosting</code> and
<code>add_to_waitlist</code> are marked with <code>pub</code>, the rest of the path works, and this
function call is valid!</p>
<p>If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code,
your public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how
they can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing
changes to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your
crate. These considerations are out of the scope of this book; if you’re
interested in this topic, see <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/">The Rust API Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>We mentioned a package can contain both a <em>src/main.rs</em> binary crate root as
well as a <em>src/lib.rs</em> library crate root, and both crates will have the
package name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing
both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary
crate to start an executable that calls code with the library crate. This
lets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package
provides, because the library crate’s code can be shared.</p>
<p>The module tree should be defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em>. Then, any public items can
be used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of the package.
The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely
external crate would use the library crate: it can only use the public API.
This helps you design a good API; not only are you the author, you’re also a
client!</p>
<p>In <a href="ch12-00-an-io-project.html">Chapter 12</a><!-- ignore -->, we’ll demonstrate this organizational
practice with a command-line program that will contain both a binary crate
and a library crate.</p>

<h3 id="starting-relative-paths-with-super"><a class="header" href="#starting-relative-paths-with-super">Starting Relative Paths with <code>super</code></a></h3>
<p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than
the current module or the crate root, by using <code>super</code> at the start of the
path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax. Using
<code>super</code> allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module,
which can make rearranging the module tree easier when the module is closely
related to the parent, but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module
tree someday.</p>
<p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef
fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The
function <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the
function <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to
<code>deliver_order</code> starting with <code>super</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path
starting with <code>super</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can
use <code>super</code> to go to the parent module of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case
is <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it.
Success! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function
are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved
together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we
used <code>super</code> so we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this
code gets moved to a different module.</p>
<h3 id="making-structs-and-enums-public"><a class="header" href="#making-structs-and-enums-public">Making Structs and Enums Public</a></h3>
<p>We can also use <code>pub</code> to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a
few details extra to the usage of <code>pub</code> with structs and enums. If we use <code>pub</code>
before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s fields
will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case
basis. In Listing 7-9, we’ve defined a public <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct
with a public <code>toast</code> field but a private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field. This models
the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that
comes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based
on what’s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so
customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &amp;str) -&gt; Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from(&quot;peaches&quot;),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer(&quot;Rye&quot;);
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from(&quot;Wheat&quot;);
    println!(&quot;I'd like {} toast please&quot;, meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from(&quot;blueberries&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some
private fields</span></p>
<p>Because the <code>toast</code> field in the <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct is public,
in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> we can write and read to the <code>toast</code> field using dot
notation. Notice that we can’t use the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because <code>seasonal_fruit</code> is private. Try uncommenting the
line modifying the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field value to see what error you get!</p>
<p>Also, note that because <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> has a private field, the
struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an
instance of <code>Breakfast</code> (we’ve named it <code>summer</code> here). If <code>Breakfast</code> didn’t
have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because we couldn’t set the value of the private
<code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We
only need the <code>pub</code> before the <code>enum</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its
variants public</span></p>
<p>Because we made the <code>Appetizer</code> enum public, we can use the <code>Soup</code> and <code>Salad</code>
variants in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying
to have to annotate all enum variants with <code>pub</code> in every case, so the default
for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their
fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything
being private by default unless annotated with <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p>There’s one more situation involving <code>pub</code> that we haven’t covered, and that is
our last module system feature: the <code>use</code> keyword. We’ll cover <code>use</code> by itself
first, and then we’ll show how to combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and
repetitive. In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to
the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, every time we wanted to call <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
we had to specify <code>front_of_house</code> and <code>hosting</code> too. Fortunately, there’s a
way to simplify this process: we can create a shortcut to a path with the <code>use</code>
keyword once, and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.</p>
<p>In Listing 7-11, we bring the <code>crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> module into the
scope of the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function so we only have to specify
<code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-11: Bringing a module into scope with

<p>Adding <code>use</code> and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in
the filesystem. By adding <code>use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> in the crate
root, <code>hosting</code> is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the <code>hosting</code>
module had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope with <code>use</code>
also check privacy, like any other paths.</p>
<p>Note that <code>use</code> only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the
<code>use</code> occurs. Listing 7-12 moves the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function into a new
child module named <code>customer</code>, which is then a different scope than the <code>use</code>
statement, so the function body won’t compile:</p>

<h3 id="creating-idiomatic-use-paths"><a class="header" href="#creating-idiomatic-use-paths">Creating Idiomatic <code>use</code> Paths</a></h3>
<p>In Listing 7-11, you might have wondered why we specified <code>use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> and then called <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> rather than specifying the <code>use</code> path all the way out to
the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-13: Bringing the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function
into scope with <code>use</code>, which is unidiomatic</span></p>
<p>Although both Listing 7-11 and 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing 7-11 is
the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with <code>use</code>. Bringing the
function’s parent module into scope with <code>use</code> means we have to specify the
parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when
calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined
while still minimizing repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13 is
unclear as to where <code>add_to_waitlist</code> is defined.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with <code>use</code>,
it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows the idiomatic way
to bring the standard library’s <code>HashMap</code> struct into the scope of a binary
crate.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-14: Bringing <code>HashMap</code> into scope in an
idiomatic way</span></p>
<p>There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has
emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.</p>
<p>The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name
into scope with <code>use</code> statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that. Listing 7-15
shows how to bring two <code>Result</code> types into scope that have the same name but
different parent modules and how to refer to them.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -&gt; fmt::Result {
    // --snip--

</span>}

fn function2() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {

</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into
the same scope requires using their parent modules.</span></p>
<p>As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two <code>Result</code> types.
If instead we specified <code>use std::fmt::Result</code> and <code>use std::io::Result</code>, we’d
have two <code>Result</code> types in the same scope and Rust wouldn’t know which one we
meant when we used <code>Result</code>.</p>
<h3 id="providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword"><a class="header" href="#providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword">Providing New Names with the <code>as</code> Keyword</a></h3>
<p>There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name
into the same scope with <code>use</code>: after the path, we can specify <code>as</code> and a new
local name, or <em>alias</em>, for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write
the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two <code>Result</code> types using <code>as</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -&gt; Result {

</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it’s brought into
scope with the <code>as</code> keyword</span></p>
<p>In the second <code>use</code> statement, we chose the new name <code>IoResult</code> for the
<code>std::io::Result</code> type, which won’t conflict with the <code>Result</code> from <code>std::fmt</code>
that we’ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are
considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!</p>
<h3 id="re-exporting-names-with-pub-use"><a class="header" href="#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">Re-exporting Names with <code>pub use</code></a></h3>
<p>When we bring a name into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword, the name available in
the new scope is private. To enable the code that calls our code to refer to
that name as if it had been defined in that code’s scope, we can combine <code>pub</code>
and <code>use</code>. This technique is called <em>re-exporting</em> because we’re bringing
an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into
their scope.</p>
<p>Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with <code>use</code> in the root module
changed to <code>pub use</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}

}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use
from a new scope with <code>pub use</code></span></p>
<p>Before this change, external code would have to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
function by using the path
<code>restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code>. Now that this <code>pub use</code> has re-exported the <code>hosting</code> module from the root module, external code
can now use the path <code>restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different
from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For
example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think
about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant
probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With
<code>pub use</code>, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different
structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on
the library and programmers calling the library. We’ll look at another example
of <code>pub use</code> and how it affects your crate’s documentation in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use">“Exporting a
Convenient Public API with <code>pub use</code>”</a><!-- ignore --> section of
Chapter 14.</p>
<h3 id="using-external-packages"><a class="header" href="#using-external-packages">Using External Packages</a></h3>
<p>In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external
package called <code>rand</code> to get random numbers. To use <code>rand</code> in our project, we
added this line to <em>Cargo.toml</em>:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:

<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">rand = &quot;0.8.5&quot;

<p>Adding <code>rand</code> as a dependency in <em>Cargo.toml</em> tells Cargo to download the
<code>rand</code> package and any dependencies from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and
make <code>rand</code> available to our project.</p>
<p>Then, to bring <code>rand</code> definitions into the scope of our package, we added a
<code>use</code> line starting with the name of the crate, <code>rand</code>, and listed the items
we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number">“Generating a Random

</code></pre>
<p>Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, and pulling any of them into your package
involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and
using <code>use</code> to bring items from their crates into scope.</p>
<p>Note that the standard <code>std</code> library is also a crate that’s external to our
package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we
don’t need to change <em>Cargo.toml</em> to include <code>std</code>. But we do need to refer to
it with <code>use</code> to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example,
with <code>HashMap</code> we would use this line:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::collections::HashMap;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This is an absolute path starting with <code>std</code>, the name of the standard library
crate.</p>

<p>If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module,
listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our
files. For example, these two <code>use</code> statements we had in the Guessing Game in
Listing 2-4 bring items from <code>std</code> into scope:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use rand::Rng;
</span>// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--
<span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one
line. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two
colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that
differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple
items with the same prefix into scope</span></p>
<p>In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or
module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate <code>use</code> statements
needed by a lot!</p>
<p>We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining
two <code>use</code> statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two
<code>use</code> statements: one that brings <code>std::io</code> into scope and one that brings
<code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-19: Two <code>use</code> statements where one is a subpath
of the other</span></p>
<p>The common part of these two paths is <code>std::io</code>, and that’s the complete first
path. To merge these two paths into one <code>use</code> statement, we can use <code>self</code> in
the nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::io::{self, Write};

<p>This line brings <code>std::io</code> and <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
<h3 id="the-glob-operator"><a class="header" href="#the-glob-operator">The Glob Operator</a></h3>
<p>If we want to bring <em>all</em> public items defined in a path into scope, we can
specify that path followed by the <code>*</code> glob operator:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::collections::*;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>use</code> statement brings all public items defined in <code>std::collections</code> into
the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it
harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program
was defined.</p>
<p>The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test
into the <code>tests</code> module; we’ll talk about that in the <a href="ch11-01-writing-tests.html#how-to-write-tests">“How to Write
Tests”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 11. The glob operator
is also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see <a href="../std/prelude/index.html#other-preludes">the standard
library documentation</a><!-- ignore -->
for more information on that pattern.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="separating-modules-into-different-files"><a class="header" href="#separating-modules-into-different-files">Separating Modules into Different Files</a></h2>
<p>So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file.
When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate
file to make the code easier to navigate.</p>
<p>For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple
restaurant modules. We’ll extract modules into files instead of having all the
modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file is
<em>src/lib.rs</em>, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root
file is <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p>First, we’ll extract the <code>front_of_house</code> module to its own file. Remove the
code inside the curly brackets for the <code>front_of_house</code> module, leaving only
the <code>mod front_of_house;</code> declaration, so that <em>src/lib.rs</em> contains the code
shown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won’t compile until we create the
<em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> file in Listing 7-22.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-21: Declaring the <code>front_of_house</code> module whose
body will be in <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em></span></p>
<p>Next, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file named
<em>src/front_of_house.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 7-22. The compiler knows to look
in this file because it came across the module declaration in the crate root
with the name <code>front_of_house</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the <code>front_of_house</code>
module in <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em></span></p>
<p>Note that you only need to load a file using a <code>mod</code> declaration <em>once</em> in your
module tree. Once the compiler knows the file is part of the project (and knows
where in the module tree the code resides because of where you’ve put the <code>mod</code>
statement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded file’s code
using a path to where it was declared, as covered in the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring
to an Item in the Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore --> section. In other words,
<code>mod</code> is <em>not</em> an “include” operation that you may have seen in other
programming languages.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll extract the <code>hosting</code> module to its own file. The process is a bit
different because <code>hosting</code> is a child module of <code>front_of_house</code>, not of the
root module. We’ll place the file for <code>hosting</code> in a new directory that will be
named for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case <em>src/front_of_house/</em>.</p>
<p>To start moving <code>hosting</code>, we change <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> to contain only the
declaration of the <code>hosting</code> module:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod hosting;
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create a <em>src/front_of_house</em> directory and a file <em>hosting.rs</em> to
contain the definitions made in the <code>hosting</code> module:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
</code></pre>
<p>If we instead put <em>hosting.rs</em> in the <em>src</em> directory, the compiler would
expect the <em>hosting.rs</em> code to be in a <code>hosting</code> module declared in the crate
root, and not declared as a child of the <code>front_of_house</code> module. The
compiler’s rules for which files to check for which modules’ code means the
directories and files more closely match the module tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="alternate-file-paths"><a class="header" href="#alternate-file-paths">Alternate File Paths</a></h3>
<p>So far we’ve covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses,
but Rust also supports an older style of file path. For a module named
<code>front_of_house</code> declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the
module’s code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> (what we covered)</li>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/mod.rs</em> (older style, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a module named <code>hosting</code> that is a submodule of <code>front_of_house</code>, the
compiler will look for the module’s code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/hosting.rs</em> (what we covered)</li>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs</em> (older style, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use both styles for the same module, you’ll get a compiler error. Using
a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is allowed, but
might be confusing for people navigating your project.</p>
<p>The main downside to the style that uses files named <em>mod.rs</em> is that your
project can end up with many files named <em>mod.rs</em>, which can get confusing
when you have them open in your editor at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve moved each module’s code to a separate file, and the module tree remains
the same. The function calls in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> will work without any
modification, even though the definitions live in different files. This
technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> statement in
<em>src/lib.rs</em> also hasn’t changed, nor does <code>use</code> have any impact on what files
are compiled as part of the crate. The <code>mod</code> keyword declares modules, and Rust
looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into
that module.</p>
<h2 id="summary-7"><a class="header" href="#summary-7">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules
so you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. You can do
this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought into
scope with a <code>use</code> statement so you can use a shorter path for multiple uses of
the item in that scope. Module code is private by default, but you can make
definitions public by adding the <code>pub</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at some collection data structures in the
standard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-collections"><a class="header" href="#common-collections">Common Collections</a></h1>
<p>Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called
<em>collections</em>. Most other data types represent one specific value, but
collections can contain multiple values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the built-in array and tuple
types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means
the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or
shrink as the program runs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each kind of collection has different capabilities
and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a
skill you’ll develop over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss three
collections that are used very often in Rust programs:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <em>vector</em> allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.</li>
<li>A <em>string</em> is a collection of characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve mentioned the <code>String</code> type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>hash map</em> allows you to associate a value with a particular key.
It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a <em>map</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library,
see <a href="../std/collections/index.html">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well
as what makes each special.</p>

<p>The first collection type we’ll look at is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, also known as a <em>vector</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that
puts all the values next to each other in memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vectors can only store values of the same type.</li>
<li>They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the
lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.</li>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-vector"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-vector">Creating a New Vector</a></h2>
<p>To create a new empty vector, we call the <code>Vec::new</code> function, as shown in
Listing 8-1.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = Vec::new();

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values
of type <code>i32</code></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that we added a type annotation here.</li>
<li>Because we aren’t inserting any
values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to
store.</li>
<li>This is an important point: Vectors are implemented using generics;
we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10.</li>
<li>For now, know that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> type provided by the standard library can hold any type.</li>
<li>When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can specify the type within
angle brackets.</li>
<li>In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in <code>v</code> will
hold elements of the <code>i32</code> type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>More often, you’ll create a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> with initial values and Rust will infer
the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type
annotation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rust conveniently provides the <code>vec!</code> macro, which will create a
new vector that holds the values you give it.</li>
<li>Listing 8-2 creates a new
<code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> that holds the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.</li>
<li>The integer type is <code>i32</code>
because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data
Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 3.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing

<p>Next, we’ll look at how to modify a vector.</p>
<h2 id="updating-a-vector"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-vector">Updating a Vector</a></h2>
<p>To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the <code>push</code> method,

<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>via indexing</li>
<li>or using the <code>get</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following examples, we’ve annotated the types of
the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.</p>
<p>Listing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with indexing
syntax and the <code>get</code> method.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &amp;i32 = &amp;v[2];
    println!(&quot;The third element is {third}&quot;);

    let third: Option&lt;&amp;i32&gt; = v.get(2);
    match third {
        Some(third) =&gt; println!(&quot;The third element is {third}&quot;),
        None =&gt; println!(&quot;There is no third element.&quot;),
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-4: Using indexing syntax or the <code>get</code> method to
access an item in a vector</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note a few details here:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We use the index value of <code>2</code> to get the third element
because vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero.</li>
<li>Using <code>&amp;</code> and <code>[]</code> gives us a reference to the element at the index value.</li>
<li>When we use the <code>get</code> method with the index passed as an argument, we get an <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code> that we can
use with <code>match</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason Rust provides these two ways to reference an element is so you can
choose how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the
range of existing elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, let’s see what happens when we have
a vector of five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100
with each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let does_not_exist = &amp;v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-5: Attempting to access the element at index
100 in a vector containing five elements</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When we run this code, the first <code>[]</code> method will cause the program to panic
because it references a nonexistent element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This method is best used when you
want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the
end of the vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the <code>get</code> method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns
<code>None</code> without panicking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would use this method if accessing an element
beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal
circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your code will then have logic to handle having either
<code>Some(&amp;element)</code> or <code>None</code>, as discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the index could be coming from a person entering a number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they accidentally enter a
number that’s too large and the program gets a <code>None</code> value, you could tell the
user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to
enter a valid value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference
and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall the
rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same
scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable reference
to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: why should a reference
to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This error is due to the way vectors work:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because vectors put the values next to each other
in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require
allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there
isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector
is currently stored.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that case, the reference to the first element would be
pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from
ending up in that situation.</p>

<p>We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we’ll look at them in more depth now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three
reasons:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors</li>
<li>strings being a more
complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for,</li>
<li>and UTF-8.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re
coming from other programming languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are
implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful
functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this section, we’ll
talk about the operations on <code>String</code> that every collection type has, such as
creating, updating, and reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll also discuss the ways in which <code>String</code>
is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a <code>String</code> is
complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret
<code>String</code> data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-string"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-string">What Is a String?</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll first define what we mean by the term <em>string</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Rust has only one string
type in the core language, which is the string slice <code>str</code> that is usually seen
in its borrowed form <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>
<li>In Chapter 4, we talked about <em>string slices</em>,
which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere.</li>
<li>String
literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary and are therefore
string slices.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>String</code> type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than
coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded
string type.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might be
referring to either the <code>String</code> or the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one
of those types.</li>
<li>Although this section is largely about <code>String</code>, both types are
used heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both <code>String</code> and string slices
are UTF-8 encoded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-string"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-string">Creating a New String</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the same operations available with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are available with <code>String</code>
as well, because <code>String</code> is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector
of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example
of a function that works the same way with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>String</code> is the <code>new</code>
function to create an instance, shown in Listing 8-11.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::new();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty <code>String</code></span></p>
<ul>
<li>This line creates a new empty string called <code>s</code>, which we can then load data
into.</li>
<li>Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string with.</li>
<li>For that, we use the <code>to_string</code> method, which is available on any type
that implements the <code>Display</code> trait, as string literals do.</li>
<li>Listing 8-12 shows two examples.</li>
</ul>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let data = &quot;initial contents&quot;;

    let s = data.to_string();

    // the method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = &quot;initial contents&quot;.to_string();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-12: Using the <code>to_string</code> method to create a
<code>String</code> from a string literal</span></p>
<p>This code creates a string containing <code>initial contents</code>.</p>
<p>We can also use the function <code>String::from</code> to create a <code>String</code> from a string
literal. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code from Listing 8-12
that uses <code>to_string</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;initial contents&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-13: Using the <code>String::from</code> function to create
a <code>String</code> from a string literal</span></p>
<p>Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic
APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem
redundant, but they all have their place!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, <code>String::from</code> and
<code>to_string</code> do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style and
readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded
data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>All of these are valid <code>String</code> values.</p>
<h2 id="updating-a-string"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-string">Updating a String</a></h2>
<p>A <code>String</code> can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents
of a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you push more data into it. In addition, you can conveniently
use the <code>+</code> operator or the <code>format!</code> macro to concatenate <code>String</code> values.</p>

<p>We can grow a <code>String</code> by using the <code>push_str</code> method to append a string slice,
as shown in Listing 8-15.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;foo&quot;);
    s.push_str(&quot;bar&quot;);

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-15: Appending a string slice to a <code>String</code>
using the <code>push_str</code> method</span></p>
<p>After these two lines, <code>s</code> will contain <code>foobar</code>. The <code>push_str</code> method takes a
string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the
parameter. For example, in the code in Listing 8-16, we want to be able to use
<code>s2</code> after appending its contents to <code>s1</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-16: Using a string slice after appending its

<p>If the <code>push_str</code> method took ownership of <code>s2</code>, we wouldn’t be able to print
its value on the last line. However, this code works as we’d expect!</p>
<p>The <code>push</code> method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the
<code>String</code>. Listing 8-17 adds the letter “l” to a <code>String</code> using the <code>push</code>
method.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;lo&quot;);

<p>Often, you’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use
the <code>+</code> operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;Hello, &quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;world!&quot;);
    let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-18: Using the <code>+</code> operator to combine two
<code>String</code> values into a new <code>String</code> value</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The string <code>s3</code> will contain <code>Hello, world!</code>.</li>
<li>The reason <code>s1</code> is no longer
valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to <code>s2</code>, has to do
with the signature of the method that’s called when we use the <code>+</code> operator.</li>
<li>The <code>+</code> operator uses the <code>add</code> method, whose signature looks something like
this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn add(self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In the standard library, you’ll see <code>add</code> defined using generics and associated
types.</li>
<li>Here, we’ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we
call this method with <code>String</code> values. We’ll discuss generics in Chapter 10.</li>
<li>This signature gives us the clues we need to understand the tricky bits of the
<code>+</code> operator.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="first-s2-has-an"><a class="header" href="#first-s2-has-an">First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code></a></h4>
<p>First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code>, meaning that we’re adding a <em>reference</em> of the second
string to the first string.</p>
<p>This is because of the <code>s</code> parameter in the <code>add</code>
function:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can only add a <code>&amp;str</code> to a <code>String</code>;</li>
<li>we can’t add two <code>String</code>
values together.</li>
<li>But wait—the type of <code>&amp;s2</code> is <code>&amp;String</code>, not <code>&amp;str</code>, as
specified in the second parameter to <code>add</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>So why does Listing 8-18 compile?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The reason we’re able to use <code>&amp;s2</code> in the call to <code>add</code> is that the compiler
can <em>coerce</em> the <code>&amp;String</code> argument into a <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>
<li>When we call the <code>add</code> method, Rust uses a <em>deref coercion</em>, which here turns <code>&amp;s2</code> into <code>&amp;s2[..]</code>.</li>
<li>We’ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15.</li>
<li>Because <code>add</code> does not take ownership of the <code>s</code> parameter, <code>s2</code> will still be a valid <code>String</code> after this operation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="second-add-takes-ownership-of-self"><a class="header" href="#second-add-takes-ownership-of-self">Second, <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code></a></h4>
<p>Second, we can see in the signature that <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code>,
because <code>self</code> does <em>not</em> have an <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>This means <code>s1</code> in Listing 8-18 will be
moved into the <code>add</code> call and will no longer be valid after that.</p>
<p>So although
<code>let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;</code> looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one,
this statement actually takes ownership of <code>s1</code>, appends a copy of the contents
of <code>s2</code>, and then returns ownership of the result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, it looks like it’s making a lot of copies but isn’t; the implementation is more efficient than copying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the <code>+</code> operator
gets unwieldy:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);

    let s = s1 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s2 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s3;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, <code>s</code> will be <code>tic-tac-toe</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all of the <code>+</code> and <code>&quot;</code>
characters, it’s difficult to see what’s going on.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-format-macro"><a class="header" href="#using-the-format-macro">Using the <code>format!</code> macro</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For more complicated string
combining, we can instead use the <code>format!</code> macro:</p>

    let s = format!(&quot;{s1}-{s2}-{s3}&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>This code also sets <code>s</code> to <code>tic-tac-toe</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>format!</code> macro works like
<code>println!</code>, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a
<code>String</code> with the contents.</li>
<li>The version of the code using <code>format!</code> is much
easier to read, and the code generated by the <code>format!</code> macro uses references
so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="indexing-into-strings"><a class="header" href="#indexing-into-strings">Indexing into Strings</a></h3>

<p>First, this one:</p>

</span>    let hello = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>In this case, <code>len</code> will be 4, which means the vector storing the string “Hola”
is 4 bytes long.</li>
<li>Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in UTF-8.</li>
<li>The following line, however, may surprise you. (Note that this string begins with the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3.)</li>
</ul>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;السلام عليكم&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Dobrý den&quot;);

</span></code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li>Asked how long the string is, you might say 12.</li>
<li>In fact, Rust’s answer is 24</li>
<li>that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode “Здравствуйте” in UTF-8, because
each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage.</li>
<li>Therefore,
an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode
scalar value.</li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;
let answer = &amp;hello[0];
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You already know that <code>answer</code> will not be <code>З</code>, the first letter.</li>
<li>When encoded
in UTF-8, the first byte of <code>З</code> is <code>208</code> and the second is <code>151</code>, so it would
seem that <code>answer</code> should in fact be <code>208</code>, but <code>208</code> is not a valid character
on its own.</li>
<li>Returning <code>208</code> is likely not what a user would want if they asked
for the first letter of this string;</li>
<li>however, that’s the only data that Rust
has at byte index 0.</li>
<li>Users generally don’t want the byte value returned, even
if the string contains only Latin letters: if <code>&amp;&quot;hello&quot;[0]</code> were valid code
that returned the byte value, it would return <code>104</code>, not <code>h</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing
bugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn’t compile this code
at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my"><a class="header" href="#bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my">Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to
look at strings from Rust’s perspective:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>as bytes,</li>
<li>scalar values,</li>
<li>and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call <em>letters</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it is
stored as a vector of <code>u8</code> values that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at
them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s <code>char</code> type is, those
bytes look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
</code></pre>
<p>There are six <code>char</code> values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:
they’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at
them as grapheme clusters, we’d get what a person would call the four letters
that make up the Hindi word:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[&quot;न&quot;, &quot;म&quot;, &quot;स्&quot;, &quot;ते&quot;]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers
store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter
what human language the data is in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a <code>String</code> to get a
character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time
(O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a <code>String</code>,
because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the
index to determine how many valid characters there were.</p>
<h3 id="slicing-strings-1"><a class="header" href="#slicing-strings-1">Slicing Strings</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the
return type of the string-indexing operation should be:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a byte value, a character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you really need to use
indices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than indexing using <code>[]</code> with a single number, you can use <code>[]</code> with a
range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;

let s = &amp;hello[0..4];
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>s</code> will be a <code>&amp;str</code> that contains the first 4 bytes of the string.
Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means
<code>s</code> will be <code>Зд</code>.</p>
<p>If we were to try to slice only part of a character’s bytes with something like
<code>&amp;hello[0..1]</code>, Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an invalid
index were accessed in a vector:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You should use ranges to create string slices with caution, because doing so
can crash your program.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="methods-for-iterating-over-strings"><a class="header" href="#methods-for-iterating-over-strings">Methods for Iterating Over Strings</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether
you want characters or bytes.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For individual Unicode scalar values, use the
<code>chars</code> method.</li>
<li>Calling <code>chars</code> on “Зд” separates out and returns two values
of type <code>char</code>, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:</li>
</ul>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">for c in &quot;Зд&quot;.chars() {
    println!(&quot;{c}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">З
д
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>bytes</code> method returns each raw byte, which might be
appropriate for your domain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">for b in &quot;Зд&quot;.bytes() {
    println!(&quot;{b}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the four bytes that make up this string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">208
151
208
180
</code></pre>
<p>But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more
than 1 byte.</p>
<p>Getting grapheme clusters from strings as with the Devanagari script is
complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library. Crates
are available on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> if this is the
functionality you need.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, strings are complicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer.</li>
<li>Rust
has chosen to make the correct handling of <code>String</code> data the default behavior
for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into
handling UTF-8 data upfront.</li>
<li>This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of
strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you
from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your
development life cycle.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built
off the <code>String</code> and <code>&amp;str</code> types to help handle these complex situations
correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like
<code>contains</code> for searching in a string and <code>replace</code> for substituting parts of a
string with another string.</p>

<p>The last of our common collections is the <em>hash map</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The type <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>
stores a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code> using a
<em>hashing function</em>, which determines how it places these keys and values into
memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but
they often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash table,
dictionary, or associative array, just to name a few.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as
you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example,
in a game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map in which
each key is a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team
name, you can retrieve its score.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies
are hiding in the functions defined on <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> by the standard library.</p>

a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.</li>
<li>Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to
the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words
that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes
“apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!</li>
<li>Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add

Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all
people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted
alphabetically.</li>

<p>We’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail, so, it’s
a perfect time to discuss error handling. We’ll do that next!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="error-handling-1"><a class="header" href="#error-handling-1">Error Handling</a></h1>
<p>Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for
handling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust requires
you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your
code will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring
that you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before you’ve
deployed your code to production!</p>
<p>Rust groups errors into two major categories: <em>recoverable</em> and <em>unrecoverable</em>
errors. For a recoverable error, such as a <em>file not found</em> error, we most
likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation.
Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a
location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the
program.</p>
<p>Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle
both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn’t have
exceptions. Instead, it has the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> for recoverable errors and
the <code>panic!</code> macro that stops execution when the program encounters an
unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling <code>panic!</code> first and then talks
about returning <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values. Additionally, we’ll explore
considerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop
execution.</p>

<p>Sometimes, bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about
it. In these cases, Rust has the <code>panic!</code> macro. There are two ways to cause a
panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic (such as
accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the <code>panic!</code> macro.
In both cases, we cause a panic in our program. By default, these panics will
print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an
environment variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a
panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic.</p>
<h2 id="unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic"><a class="header" href="#unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic">Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts <em>unwinding</em>, which
means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function
it encounters. However, this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. Rust,
therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately <em>aborting</em>,
which ends the program without cleaning up.</p>
<p>Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned
up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting
binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a
panic by adding <code>panic = 'abort'</code> to the appropriate <code>[profile]</code> sections in
your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release
mode, add this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try calling <code>panic!</code> in a simple program:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics">fn main() {
    panic!(&quot;crash and burn&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run the program, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>panic!</code> causes the error message contained in the last two lines.
The first line shows our panic message and the place in our source code where
the panic occurred: <em>src/main.rs:2:5</em> indicates that it’s the second line,
fifth character of our <em>src/main.rs</em> file.</p>
<p>In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that
line, we see the <code>panic!</code> macro call. In other cases, the <code>panic!</code> call might
be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by
the error message will be someone else’s code where the <code>panic!</code> macro is
called, not the line of our code that eventually led to the <code>panic!</code> call. We
can use the backtrace of the functions the <code>panic!</code> call came from to figure
out the part of our code that is causing the problem. We’ll discuss backtraces
in more detail next.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-panic-backtrace"><a class="header" href="#using-a-panic-backtrace">Using a <code>panic!</code> Backtrace</a></h2>
<p>Let’s look at another example to see what it’s like when a <code>panic!</code> call comes
from a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling
the macro directly. Listing 9-1 has some code that attempts to access an
index in a vector beyond the range of valid indexes.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-1: Attempting to access an element beyond the
end of a vector, which will cause a call to <code>panic!</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’re attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which is at
index 99 because indexing starts at zero), but the vector has only 3 elements.
In this situation, Rust will panic. Using <code>[]</code> is supposed to return an
element, but if you pass an invalid index, there’s no element that Rust could
return here that would be correct.</p>
<p>In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined
behavior. You might get whatever is at the location in memory that would
correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory
doesn’t belong to that structure. This is called a <em>buffer overread</em> and can
lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the index
in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to that is stored after
the data structure.</p>
<p>To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an
element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to
continue. Let’s try it and see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99', src/main.rs:4:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>This error points at line 4 of our <code>main.rs</code> where we attempt to access index
99. The next note line tells us that we can set the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code>
environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the
error. A <em>backtrace</em> is a list of all the functions that have been called to
get to this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: the
key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see
files you wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above
that spot are code that your code has called; the lines below are code that
called your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code,
standard library code, or crates that you’re using. Let’s try getting a
backtrace by setting the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to any value
except 0. Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you’ll see.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-2: The backtrace generated by a call to

<p>That’s a lot of output! The exact output you see might be different depending
on your operating system and Rust version. In order to get backtraces with this
information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by
default when using <code>cargo build</code> or <code>cargo run</code> without the <code>--release</code> flag,
as we have here.</p>
<p>In the output in Listing 9-2, line 6 of the backtrace points to the line in our
project that’s causing the problem: line 4 of <em>src/main.rs</em>. If we don’t want
our program to panic, we should start our investigation at the location pointed
to by the first line mentioning a file we wrote. In Listing 9-1, where we
deliberately wrote code that would panic, the way to fix the panic is to not
request an element beyond the range of the vector indexes. When your code
panics in the future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking
with what values to cause the panic and what the code should do instead.</p>

<p>We choose <code>io::Error</code> as the return type of this function because that happens to be the
type of the error value returned from both of the operations we’re calling in
this function’s body that might fail: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>the <code>File::open</code> function and the <code>read_to_string</code> method.</p>
</div>
</details>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The body of the function starts by calling the <code>File::open</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we
handle the <code>Result</code> value with a <code>match</code> similar to the <code>match</code> in Listing 9-4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable <code>file</code>
becomes the value in the mutable variable <code>username_file</code> and the function
continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <code>Err</code> case, instead of calling <code>panic!</code>, we use the <code>return</code>
keyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value
from <code>File::open</code>, now in the pattern variable <code>e</code>, back to the calling code as
this function’s error value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So if we have a file handle in <code>username_file</code>, the function then creates a new
<code>String</code> in variable <code>username</code> and calls the <code>read_to_string</code> method on
the file handle in <code>username_file</code> to read the contents of the file into
<code>username</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>read_to_string</code> method also returns a <code>Result</code> because it
might fail, even though <code>File::open</code> succeeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So we need another <code>match</code> to
handle that <code>Result</code>: if <code>read_to_string</code> succeeds, then our function has
succeeded, and we return the username from the file that’s now in <code>username</code>
wrapped in an <code>Ok</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>read_to_string</code> fails, we return the error value in the
same way that we returned the error value in the <code>match</code> that handled the
return value of <code>File::open</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, we don’t need to explicitly say
<code>return</code>, because this is the last expression in the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an <code>Ok</code> value
that contains a username or an <code>Err</code> value that contains an <code>io::Error</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>?</code> placed after a <code>Result</code> value is defined to work in almost the same way

<blockquote>
<p>There is a difference between what the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 9-6 does
and what the <code>?</code> operator does:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>error values that have the <code>?</code> operator called
on them go through the <code>from</code> function, defined in the <code>From</code> trait in the
standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the <code>?</code> operator calls the <code>from</code> function, the error type received is
converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current
function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent
all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different
reasons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we could change the <code>read_username_from_file</code> function in Listing
9-7 to return a custom error type named <code>OurError</code> that we define.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we also
define <code>impl From&lt;io::Error&gt; for OurError</code> to construct an instance of
<code>OurError</code> from an <code>io::Error</code>, then the <code>?</code> operator calls in the body of
<code>read_username_from_file</code> will call <code>from</code> and convert the error types without
needing to add any more code to the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of Listing 9-7, the <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>File::open</code> call will
return the value inside an <code>Ok</code> to the variable <code>username_file</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an error
occurs, the <code>?</code> operator will return early out of the whole function and give
any <code>Err</code> value to the calling code.</li>
<li>The same thing applies to the <code>?</code> at the
end of the <code>read_to_string</code> call.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s
implementation simpler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We could even shorten this code further by chaining
method calls immediately after the <code>?</code>, as shown in Listing 9-8.</p>

<p>So how do you decide when you should call <code>panic!</code> and when you should return
<code>Result</code>? When code panics, there’s no way to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code>
for any error situation, whether there’s a possible way to recover or not, but
then you’re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of
the calling code. When you choose to return a <code>Result</code> value, you give the
calling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a
way that’s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code>
value in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call <code>panic!</code> and turn your
recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a
good default choice when you’re defining a function that might fail.</p>
<p>In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it’s more
appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a <code>Result</code>. Let’s
explore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can’t tell that
failure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with
some general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.</p>
<h2 id="examples-prototype-code-and-tests"><a class="header" href="#examples-prototype-code-and-tests">Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests</a></h2>
<p>When you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust
error-handling code can make the example less clear. In
examples, it’s understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could
panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you’d want your application to
handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> methods are very handy when prototyping,
before you’re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in
your code for when you’re ready to make your program more robust.</p>
<p>If a method call fails in a test, you’d want the whole test to fail, even if
that method isn’t the functionality under test. Because <code>panic!</code> is how a test
is marked as a failure, calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> is exactly what should
happen.</p>
<h2 id="cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler">Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler</a></h2>
<p>It would also be appropriate to call <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> when you have some
other logic that ensures the <code>Result</code> will have an <code>Ok</code> value, but the logic
isn’t something the compiler understands. You’ll still have a <code>Result</code> value
that you need to handle: whatever operation you’re calling still has the
possibility of failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in
your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code
that you’ll never have an <code>Err</code> variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call
<code>unwrap</code>, and even better to document the reason you think you’ll never have an
<code>Err</code> variant in the <code>expect</code> text. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>{{# rustdoc_include../ listings / ch09 - error -handling / no - listing - 08 - unwrap -that - cant - fail / src / main.rs: here}}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We’re creating an <code>IpAddr</code> instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see
that <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use <code>expect</code>
here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return type
of the <code>parse</code> method: we still get a <code>Result</code> value, and the compiler will
still make us handle the <code>Result</code> as if the <code>Err</code> variant is a possibility
because the compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is always a
valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being
hardcoded into the program and therefore <em>did</em> have a possibility of failure,
we’d definitely want to handle the <code>Result</code> in a more robust way instead.
Mentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to
change <code>expect</code> to better error handling code if in the future, we need to get
the IP address from some other source instead.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#guidelines-for-error-handling">Guidelines for Error Handling</a></h2>
<p>It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code
could end up in a bad state. In this context, a <em>bad state</em> is when some
assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when
invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your
code—plus one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that
will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong
format.</li>
<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,
rather than checking for the problem at every step.</li>
<li>There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll
work through an example of what we mean in the <a href="ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types">“Encoding States and Behavior
as Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 17.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, it’s
best to return an error if you can so the user of the library can decide what
they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be
insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call <code>panic!</code> and alert the
person using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during
development. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is often appropriate if you’re calling
external code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that
you have no way of fixing.</p>
<p>However, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a <code>Result</code>
than to make a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples include a parser being given malformed
data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
limit. In these cases, returning a <code>Result</code> indicates that failure is an
expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.</p>
<p>When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it’s
called using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first
and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:
attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.
This is the main reason the standard library will call <code>panic!</code> if you attempt
an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn’t belong to
the current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have
<em>contracts</em>: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular
requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a
contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it’s not a kind of
error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there’s
no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling <em>programmers</em> need
to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will
cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.</p>
<p>However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose
and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type
checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your
function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s
logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For
example, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to
have <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em>. Your code then doesn’t have to handle
two cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it will only have one case for
definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t
even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime.
Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as <code>u32</code>, which ensures
the parameter is never negative.</p>
<h2 id="creating-custom-types-for-validation"><a class="header" href="#creating-custom-types-for-validation">Creating Custom Types for Validation</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take the idea of using Rust’s type system to ensure we have a valid value
one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the
guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those
numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that
the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our
output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. But it would be a
useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different
behavior when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user
types, for example, letters instead.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an <code>i32</code> instead of only a
<code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
number being in range, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use rand::Rng;
</span><span class="boring">use std::cmp::Ordering;
</span><span class="boring">use std::io;

            Ok(num) =&gt; num,
            Err(_) =&gt; continue,
        };

        if guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 {
            println!(&quot;The secret number will be between 1 and 100.&quot;);
            continue;
        }

        match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
            // --snip--
<span class="boring">            Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(&quot;Too small!&quot;),
</span><span class="boring">            Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
</span><span class="boring">            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {
</span><span class="boring">                println!(&quot;You win!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">                break;
</span><span class="boring">            }
</span><span class="boring">        }
</span>    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user
about the problem, and calls <code>continue</code> to start the next iteration of the loop
and ask for another guess. After the <code>if</code> expression, we can proceed with the
comparisons between <code>guess</code> and the secret number knowing that <code>guess</code> is
between 1 and 100.</p>
<p>However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the
program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions
with this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be
tedious (and might impact performance).</p>
<p>Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create
an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That
way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and
confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a
<code>Guess</code> type that will only create an instance of <code>Guess</code> if the <code>new</code> function
receives a value between 1 and 100.</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-13: A <code>Guess</code> type that will only continue with
values between 1 and 100</span></p>
<p>First, we define a struct named <code>Guess</code> that has a field named <code>value</code> that
holds an <code>i32</code>. This is where the number will be stored.</p>
<p>Then we implement an associated function named <code>new</code> on <code>Guess</code> that creates
instances of <code>Guess</code> values. The <code>new</code> function is defined to have one
parameter named <code>value</code> of type <code>i32</code> and to return a <code>Guess</code>. The code in the
body of the <code>new</code> function tests <code>value</code> to make sure it’s between 1 and 100.
If <code>value</code> doesn’t pass this test, we make a <code>panic!</code> call, which will alert
the programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need
to fix, because creating a <code>Guess</code> with a <code>value</code> outside this range would
violate the contract that <code>Guess::new</code> is relying on. The conditions in which
<code>Guess::new</code> might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API
documentation; we’ll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility
of a <code>panic!</code> in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If
<code>value</code> does pass the test, we create a new <code>Guess</code> with its <code>value</code> field set
to the <code>value</code> parameter and return the <code>Guess</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we implement a method named <code>value</code> that borrows <code>self</code>, doesn’t have any
other parameters, and returns an <code>i32</code>. This kind of method is sometimes called
a <em>getter</em>, because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return
it. This public method is necessary because the <code>value</code> field of the <code>Guess</code>
struct is private. It’s important that the <code>value</code> field be private so code
using the <code>Guess</code> struct is not allowed to set <code>value</code> directly: code outside
the module <em>must</em> use the <code>Guess::new</code> function to create an instance of
<code>Guess</code>, thereby ensuring there’s no way for a <code>Guess</code> to have a <code>value</code> that
hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the <code>Guess::new</code> function.</p>
<p>A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could
then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a <code>Guess</code> rather than an
<code>i32</code> and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.</p>

<p>Rust’s error handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.
The <code>panic!</code> macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t handle and
lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The <code>Result</code> enum uses Rust’s type system to indicate that
operations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use
<code>Result</code> to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using <code>panic!</code> and <code>Result</code> in the appropriate
situations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with
the <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> enums, we’ll talk about how generics work and how you
can use them in your code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes">Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes</a></h1>
<p>Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication
of concepts. In Rust, one such tool is <em>generics</em>: abstract stand-ins for
concrete types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or
how they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place
when compiling and running the code.</p>
<p>Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type
like <code>i32</code> or <code>String</code>, in the same way a function takes parameters with
unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we’ve
already used generics in Chapter 6 with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, Chapter 8 with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
and <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>, and Chapter 9 with <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. In this chapter, you’ll
explore how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!</p>
<p>First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. We’ll
then use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that
differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also explain how to use
generic types in struct and enum definitions.</p>
<p>Then you’ll learn how to use <em>traits</em> to define behavior in a generic way. You
can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept
only those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll discuss <em>lifetimes</em>: a variety of generics that give the
compiler information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes allow
us to give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that it can
ensure references will be valid in more situations than it could without our
help.</p>
<h2 id="removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function"><a class="header" href="#removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function">Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function</a></h2>
<p>Generics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that represents
multiple types to remove code duplication. Before diving into generics syntax,
then, let’s first look at how to remove duplication in a way that doesn’t
involve generic types by extracting a function that replaces specific values
with a placeholder that represents multiple values. Then we’ll apply the same
technique to extract a generic function! By looking at how to recognize
duplicated code you can extract into a function, you’ll start to recognize
duplicated code that can use generics.</p>
<p>We begin with the short program in Listing 10-1 that finds the largest number
in a list.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
<span class="boring">    assert_eq!(*largest, 100);
</span>}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-1: Finding the largest number in a list of
numbers</span></p>
<p>We store a list of integers in the variable <code>number_list</code> and place a reference
to the first number in the list in a variable named <code>largest</code>. We then iterate
through all the numbers in the list, and if the current number is greater than
the number stored in <code>largest</code>, replace the reference in that variable.
However, if the current number is less than or equal to the largest number seen
so far, the variable doesn’t change, and the code moves on to the next number
in the list. After considering all the numbers in the list, <code>largest</code> should
refer to the largest number, which in this case is 100.</p>
<p>We’ve now been tasked with finding the largest number in two different lists of
numbers. To do so, we can choose to duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and use
the same logic at two different places in the program, as shown in Listing 10-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-2: Code to find the largest number in <em>two</em>
lists of numbers</span></p>
<p>Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error prone. We also
have to remember to update the code in multiple places when we want to change
it.</p>
<p>To eliminate this duplication, we’ll create an abstraction by defining a
function that operates on any list of integers passed in a parameter. This
solution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of finding the
largest number in a list abstractly.</p>
<p>In Listing 10-3, we extract the code that finds the largest number into a
function named <code>largest</code>. Then we call the function to find the largest number
in the two lists from Listing 10-2. We could also use the function on any other
list of <code>i32</code> values we might have in the future.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn largest(list: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; &amp;i32 {

        if item &gt; largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
<span class="boring">    assert_eq!(*result, 100);
</span>
    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
<span class="boring">    assert_eq!(*result, 6000);
</span>}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number
in two lists</span></p>
<p>The <code>largest</code> function has a parameter called <code>list</code>, which represents any
concrete slice of <code>i32</code> values we might pass into the function. As a result,
when we call the function, the code runs on the specific values that we pass
in.</p>
<p>In summary, here are the steps we took to change the code from Listing 10-2 to
Listing 10-3:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate code.</li>
<li>Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function and specify the
inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.</li>
<li>Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we’ll use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication. In
the same way that the function body can operate on an abstract <code>list</code> instead
of specific values, generics allow code to operate on abstract types.</p>
<p>For example, say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item in a
slice of <code>i32</code> values and one that finds the largest item in a slice of <code>char</code>
values. How would we eliminate that duplication? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or

generics. </p>
<p>Then we’ll discuss how generics affect code performance.</p>
<h2 id="in-function-definitions"><a class="header" href="#in-function-definitions">In Function Definitions</a></h2>

</ul>
<p>The function bodies have the same code, so let’s eliminate
the duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.</p>
<p>To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type
parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. </p>
<p>You can use
any identifier as a type parameter name. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we’ll use <code>T</code> because, by
convention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just a letter, and Rust’s
type-naming convention is CamelCase. Short for “type,” <code>T</code> is the default
choice of most Rust programmers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the
parameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name means.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we have
to declare the type parameter name before we use it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To define the generic
<code>largest</code> function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:</p>

<li>the function <code>largest</code> is generic over some type
<code>T</code>. </li>
<li>This function has one parameter named <code>list</code>, which is a slice of values
of type <code>T</code>. </li>
<li>The <code>largest</code> function will return a reference to a value of the
same type <code>T</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listing 10-5 shows the combined <code>largest</code> function definition using the generic

<p>The help text mentions <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code>, which is a <em>trait</em>, and we’re
going to talk about traits in the next section. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now, know that this error
states that the body of <code>largest</code> won’t work for all possible types that <code>T</code>
could be. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we want to compare values of type <code>T</code> in the body, we can
only use types whose values can be ordered. </p>
<p>To enable comparisons, the standard
library has the <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code> trait that you can implement on types
(see Appendix C for more on this trait). </p>
<p>By following the help text’s
suggestion, we restrict the types valid for <code>T</code> to only those that implement
<code>PartialOrd</code> and this example will compile, because the standard library
implements <code>PartialOrd</code> on both <code>i32</code> and <code>char</code>.</p>

<h3 id="option"><a class="header" href="#option">Option</a></h3>
<p>As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their
variants. </p>
<p>Let’s take another look at the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum that the standard
library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This definition should now make more sense to you：</p>
<ol>
<li>As you can see, the
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is generic over type <code>T</code> and has two variants: </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>Some</code>, which
holds one value of type <code>T</code></li>
<li>and a <code>None</code> variant that doesn’t hold any value.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By using the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum, we can express the abstract concept of an
optional value, and because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is generic, we can use this abstraction
no matter what the type of the optional value is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enums can use multiple generic types as well. </p>
<h3 id="result"><a class="header" href="#result">Result</a></h3>
<p>The definition of the <code>Result</code>
enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),

</span></code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Result</code> enum is generic over two types, <code>T</code> and <code>E</code>, and has two variants:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>Ok</code>, which holds a value of type <code>T</code>, and <code>Err</code>, which holds a value of type
<code>E</code>. </li>
<li>This definition makes it convenient to use the <code>Result</code> enum anywhere we
have an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type <code>T</code>) or fail
(return an error of some type <code>E</code>). </li>
<li>In fact, this is what we used to open a
file in Listing 9-3, where <code>T</code> was filled in with the type <code>std::fs::File</code> when
the file was opened successfully and <code>E</code> was filled in with the type
<code>std::io::Error</code> when there were problems opening the file.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can
avoid duplication by using generic types instead.</p>

<p>You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type
parameters. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good news is that using generic types won’t make your program run 
any slower than it would with concrete types.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using
generics at compile time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Monomorphization</em> is the process of turning generic
code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when
compiled. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used
to create the generic function in Listing 10-5: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the compiler looks at all the
places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types
the generic code is called with.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how this works by using the standard library’s generic
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization. </p>
<p>During that
process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
instances and identifies two kinds of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>: </p>
<p>one is <code>i32</code> and the other is <code>f64</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As such, it expands the generic definition of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> into two
definitions specialized to <code>i32</code> and <code>f64</code>, thereby replacing the generic
definition with the specific ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the
compiler uses different names than what we’re using here for illustration):</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Option_i32 {

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The generic <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is replaced with the specific definitions created by
the compiler. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the
type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the code
runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by
hand. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient

<p>A <em>trait</em> defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other
types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can
use <em>trait bounds</em> to specify that a generic type can be any type that has
certain behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called <em>interfaces</em> in other
languages, although with some differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="defining-a-trait"><a class="header" href="#defining-a-trait">Defining a Trait</a></h2>
<p>A type’s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different
types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those
types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to
define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and
amounts of text: a <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that holds a news story filed in a
particular location and a <code>Tweet</code> that can have at most 280 characters along
with metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply
to another tweet.</p>
<p>We want to make a media aggregator library crate named <code>aggregator</code> that can
display summaries of data that might be stored in a <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>
instance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we’ll request
that summary by calling a <code>summarize</code> method on an instance. Listing 10-12
shows the definition of a public <code>Summary</code> trait that expresses this behavior.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-12: A <code>Summary</code> trait that consists of the
behavior provided by a <code>summarize</code> method</span></p>
<p>Here, we declare a trait using the <code>trait</code> keyword and then the trait’s name,
which is <code>Summary</code> in this case. We’ve also declared the trait as <code>pub</code> so that
crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we’ll see in
a few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures
that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in
this case is <code>fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String</code>.</p>
<p>After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly
brackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide
its own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce
that any type that has the <code>Summary</code> trait will have the method <code>summarize</code>
defined with this signature exactly.</p>
<p>A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed
one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-a-trait-on-a-type"><a class="header" href="#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type">Implementing a Trait on a Type</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve defined the desired signatures of the <code>Summary</code> trait’s methods,
we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows
an implementation of the <code>Summary</code> trait on the <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that uses
the headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of
<code>summarize</code>. For the <code>Tweet</code> struct, we define <code>summarize</code> as the username
followed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is
already limited to 280 characters.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;{}, by {} ({})&quot;, self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;{}: {}&quot;, self.username, self.content)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-13: Implementing the <code>Summary</code> trait on the
<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types</span></p>
<p>Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The
difference is that after <code>impl</code>, we put the trait name we want to implement,
then use the <code>for</code> keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to
implement the trait for. Within the <code>impl</code> block, we put the method signatures
that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each
signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific
behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.</p>
<p>Now that the library has implemented the <code>Summary</code> trait on <code>NewsArticle</code> and
<code>Tweet</code>, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of
<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> in the same way we call regular methods. The only
difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the
types. Here’s an example of how a binary crate could use our <code>aggregator</code>
library crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from(&quot;horse_ebooks&quot;),
        content: String::from(
            &quot;of course, as you probably already know, people&quot;,
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!(&quot;1 new tweet: {}&quot;, tweet.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code prints <code>1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people</code>.</p>
<p>Other crates that depend on the <code>aggregator</code> crate can also bring the <code>Summary</code>
trait into scope to implement <code>Summary</code> on their own types. One restriction to
note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the
trait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard
library traits like <code>Display</code> on a custom type like <code>Tweet</code> as part of our
<code>aggregator</code> crate functionality, because the type <code>Tweet</code> is local to our
<code>aggregator</code> crate. We can also implement <code>Summary</code> on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in our
<code>aggregator</code> crate, because the trait <code>Summary</code> is local to our <code>aggregator</code>
crate.</p>
<p>But we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t
implement the <code>Display</code> trait on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> within our <code>aggregator</code> crate,
because <code>Display</code> and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are both defined in the standard library and
aren’t local to our <code>aggregator</code> crate. This restriction is part of a property
called <em>coherence</em>, and more specifically the <em>orphan rule</em>, so named because
the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s code
can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could
implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which
implementation to use.</p>
<h2 id="default-implementations"><a class="header" href="#default-implementations">Default Implementations</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods
in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.
Then, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override
each method’s default behavior.</p>
<p>In Listing 10-14 we specify a default string for the <code>summarize</code> method of the
<code>Summary</code> trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in
Listing 10-12.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait Summary {

</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-14: Defining a <code>Summary</code> trait with a default
implementation of the <code>summarize</code> method</span></p>
<p>To use a default implementation to summarize instances of <code>NewsArticle</code>, we
specify an empty <code>impl</code> block with <code>impl Summary for NewsArticle {}</code>.</p>
<p>Even though we’re no longer defining the <code>summarize</code> method on <code>NewsArticle</code>
directly, we’ve provided a default implementation and specified that
<code>NewsArticle</code> implements the <code>Summary</code> trait. As a result, we can still call
the <code>summarize</code> method on an instance of <code>NewsArticle</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use aggregator::{self, NewsArticle, Summary};
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let article = NewsArticle {
        headline: String::from(&quot;Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!&quot;),
        location: String::from(&quot;Pittsburgh, PA, USA&quot;),
        author: String::from(&quot;Iceburgh&quot;),
        content: String::from(
            &quot;The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
             hockey team in the NHL.&quot;,
        ),
    };

    println!(&quot;New article available! {}&quot;, article.summarize());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code prints <code>New article available! (Read more...)</code>.</p>
<p>Creating a default implementation doesn’t require us to change anything about
the implementation of <code>Summary</code> on <code>Tweet</code> in Listing 10-13. The reason is that
the syntax for overriding a default implementation is the same as the syntax
for implementing a trait method that doesn’t have a default implementation.</p>
<p>Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those
other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can
provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify
a small part of it. For example, we could define the <code>Summary</code> trait to have a
<code>summarize_author</code> method whose implementation is required, and then define a
<code>summarize</code> method that has a default implementation that calls the
<code>summarize_author</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String;

    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;(Read more from {}...)&quot;, self.summarize_author())
    }
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">pub struct Tweet {
</span><span class="boring">    pub username: String,
</span><span class="boring">    pub content: String,
</span><span class="boring">    pub reply: bool,
</span><span class="boring">    pub retweet: bool,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">impl Summary for Tweet {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
</span><span class="boring">        format!(&quot;@{}&quot;, self.username)
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>To use this version of <code>Summary</code>, we only need to define <code>summarize_author</code>
when we implement the trait on a type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
</span><span class="boring">        format!(&quot;(Read more from {}...)&quot;, self.summarize_author())
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">pub struct Tweet {
</span><span class="boring">    pub username: String,

</span><span class="boring">
</span>impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;@{}&quot;, self.username)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>After we define <code>summarize_author</code>, we can call <code>summarize</code> on instances of the
<code>Tweet</code> struct, and the default implementation of <code>summarize</code> will call the
definition of <code>summarize_author</code> that we’ve provided. Because we’ve implemented
<code>summarize_author</code>, the <code>Summary</code> trait has given us the behavior of the
<code>summarize</code> method without requiring us to write any more code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use aggregator::{self, Summary, Tweet};
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from(&quot;horse_ebooks&quot;),
        content: String::from(
            &quot;of course, as you probably already know, people&quot;,
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!(&quot;1 new tweet: {}&quot;, tweet.summarize());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code prints <code>1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)</code>.</p>
<p>Note that it isn’t possible to call the default implementation from an
overriding implementation of that same method.</p>
<h2 id="traits-as-parameters"><a class="header" href="#traits-as-parameters">Traits as Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to use
traits to define functions that accept many different types. We’ll use the
<code>Summary</code> trait we implemented on the <code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types in
Listing 10-13 to define a <code>notify</code> function that calls the <code>summarize</code> method
on its <code>item</code> parameter, which is of some type that implements the <code>Summary</code>
trait. To do this, we use the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">pub struct NewsArticle {

</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">impl Summary for NewsArticle {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
</span><span class="boring">        format!(&quot;{}, by {} ({})&quot;, self.headline, self.author, self.location)
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">pub struct Tweet {
</span><span class="boring">    pub username: String,
</span><span class="boring">    pub content: String,
</span><span class="boring">    pub reply: bool,
</span><span class="boring">    pub retweet: bool,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">impl Summary for Tweet {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
</span><span class="boring">        format!(&quot;{}: {}&quot;, self.username, self.content)
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>pub fn notify(item: &amp;impl Summary) {
    println!(&quot;Breaking news! {}&quot;, item.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a concrete type for the <code>item</code> parameter, we specify the <code>impl</code>
keyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the
specified trait. In the body of <code>notify</code>, we can call any methods on <code>item</code>
that come from the <code>Summary</code> trait, such as <code>summarize</code>. We can call <code>notify</code>
and pass in any instance of <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>. Code that calls the
function with any other type, such as a <code>String</code> or an <code>i32</code>, won’t compile
because those types don’t implement <code>Summary</code>.</p>

<p><a id="fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds"></a></p>
<h3 id="trait-bound-syntax"><a class="header" href="#trait-bound-syntax">Trait Bound Syntax</a></h3>
<p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax
sugar for a longer form known as a <em>trait bound</em>; it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary&gt;(item: &amp;T) {
    println!(&quot;Breaking news! {}&quot;, item.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is
more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type
parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.</p>
<p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple
cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other
cases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement <code>Summary</code>. Doing
so with the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify(item1: &amp;impl Summary, item2: &amp;impl Summary) {
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>impl Trait</code> is appropriate if we want this function to allow <code>item1</code> and
<code>item2</code> to have different types (as long as both types implement <code>Summary</code>). If
we want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use a
trait bound, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary&gt;(item1: &amp;T, item2: &amp;T) {
</code></pre>
<p>The generic type <code>T</code> specified as the type of the <code>item1</code> and <code>item2</code>
parameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value
passed as an argument for <code>item1</code> and <code>item2</code> must be the same.</p>
<h3 id="specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax"><a class="header" href="#specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax">Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the <code>+</code> Syntax</a></h3>
<p>We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted <code>notify</code> to use
display formatting as well as <code>summarize</code> on <code>item</code>: we specify in the <code>notify</code>
definition that <code>item</code> must implement both <code>Display</code> and <code>Summary</code>. We can do
so using the <code>+</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify(item: &amp;(impl Summary + Display)) {
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+</code> syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary + Display&gt;(item: &amp;T) {
</code></pre>
<p>With the two trait bounds specified, the body of <code>notify</code> can call <code>summarize</code>
and use <code>{}</code> to format <code>item</code>.</p>
<h3 id="clearer-trait-bounds-with-where-clauses"><a class="header" href="#clearer-trait-bounds-with-where-clauses">Clearer Trait Bounds with <code>where</code> Clauses</a></h3>
<p>Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait
bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of
trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list,
making the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate
syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a <code>where</code> clause after the function
signature. So instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug&gt;(t: &amp;T, u: &amp;U) -&gt; i32 {
</code></pre>
<p>we can use a <code>where</code> clause, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T, U&gt;(t: &amp;T, u: &amp;U) -&gt; i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
<span class="boring">    unimplemented!()
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This function’s signature is less cluttered: the function name, parameter list,
and return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait
bounds.</p>
<h2 id="returning-types-that-implement-traits"><a class="header" href="#returning-types-that-implement-traits">Returning Types that Implement Traits</a></h2>
<p>We can also use the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax in the return position to return a
value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;

        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By using <code>impl Summary</code> for the return type, we specify that the
<code>returns_summarizable</code> function returns some type that implements the <code>Summary</code>
trait without naming the concrete type. In this case, <code>returns_summarizable</code>
returns a <code>Tweet</code>, but the code calling this function doesn’t need to know that.</p>
<p>The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is
especially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we cover in
Chapter 13. Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows or
types that are very long to specify. The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax lets you concisely
specify that a function returns some type that implements the <code>Iterator</code> trait
without needing to write out a very long type.</p>
<p>However, you can only use <code>impl Trait</code> if you’re returning a single type. For
example, this code that returns either a <code>NewsArticle</code> or a <code>Tweet</code> with the
return type specified as <code>impl Summary</code> wouldn’t work:</p>

<p>Returning either a <code>NewsArticle</code> or a <code>Tweet</code> isn’t allowed due to restrictions
around how the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax is implemented in the compiler. We’ll cover
how to write a function with this behavior in the <a href="ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types">“Using Trait Objects That
Allow for Values of Different
Types”</a><!--

<h2 id="using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods"><a class="header" href="#using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods">Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods</a></h2>
<p>By using a trait bound with an <code>impl</code> block that uses generic type parameters,
we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified
traits. For example, the type <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing 10-15 always implements the
<code>new</code> function to return a new instance of <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> (recall from the
<a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#defining-methods">“Defining Methods”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5 that <code>Self</code>
is a type alias for the type of the <code>impl</code> block, which in this case is
<code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code>). But in the next <code>impl</code> block, <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> only implements the
<code>cmp_display</code> method if its inner type <code>T</code> implements the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait
that enables comparison <em>and</em> the <code>Display</code> trait that enables printing.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl&lt;T: Display + PartialOrd&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn cmp_display(&amp;self) {
        if self.x &gt;= self.y {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is x = {}&quot;, self.x);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is y = {}&quot;, self.y);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-15: Conditionally implementing methods on a
generic type depending on trait bounds</span></p>
<p>We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait
bounds are called <em>blanket implementations</em> and are extensively used in the
Rust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the
<code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements the <code>Display</code> trait. The <code>impl</code>
block in the standard library looks similar to this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T: Display&gt; ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the
<code>to_string</code> method defined by the <code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements
the <code>Display</code> trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding
<code>String</code> values like this because integers implement <code>Display</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = 3.to_string();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.</p>
<p>Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to
reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic
type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound
information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the
correct behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at
runtime if we called a method on a type which didn’t define the method. But Rust
moves these errors to compile time so we’re forced to fix the problems before
our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don’t have to write code that
checks for behavior at runtime because we’ve already checked at compile time.
Doing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of
generics.</p>

<p>Lifetimes are <strong>another kind of generic</strong> that we’ve already been using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that
references are valid as long as we need them to be.</p>
<p>One detail we didn’t discuss in the <a href="ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing">“References and
Borrowing”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 is
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>every reference in Rust has a <em>lifetime</em>, which is the scope for which
that reference is valid.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We only must annotate types when multiple types are possible.</li>
<li>In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes
when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways.</li>
<li>Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using <strong>generic lifetime parameters</strong> to
ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Annotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages
have, so this is going to feel unfamiliar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we won’t cover lifetimes in
their entirety in this chapter, we’ll discuss common ways you might encounter
lifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the concept.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes">Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent <em>dangling references</em>, which cause a
program to reference data other than the data it’s intended to reference.</p>
<p>Consider the program in Listing 10-16, which has an outer scope and an inner
scope.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The examples in Listings 10-16, 10-17, and 10-23 declare variables without giving them an initial value, so the variable name exists in the
outer scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with Rust’s having no null values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if we try to use a variable before giving it a value, we’ll get a compile-time error, which shows that Rust indeed does
not allow null values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outer scope declares a variable named <code>r</code> with no initial value, and the
inner scope declares a variable named <code>x</code> with the initial value of 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the inner scope, we attempt to set the value of <code>r</code> as a reference to <code>x</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print the value in <code>r</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This code won’t compile because the value <code>r</code> is referring to has gone out of scope before we

<p>The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter
on it because Rust can’t tell whether the reference being returned refers to
<code>x</code> or <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Actually, we don’t know either, because the <code>if</code> block in the body
of this function returns a reference to <code>x</code> and the <code>else</code> block returns a
reference to <code>y</code>!</p>
<p>When we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values that will
be passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the <code>if</code> case or the
<code>else</code> case will execute.</p>
<p>We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the
references that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes as we did in
Listings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine whether the reference we return will
always be valid.</p>
<p>The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it
doesn’t know how the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> relate to the lifetime of the
return value.</p>

when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept
references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax:</p>

<ul>
<li>the names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) and are usually all lowercase
and very short, like generic types.</li>
<li>Most people use the name <code>'a</code> for the first

<li>We place lifetime parameter annotations after the <code>&amp;</code> of a
reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a reference to an <code>i32</code> without a lifetime parameter</li>
<li>a reference to an <code>i32</code> that has a lifetime parameter named <code>'a</code></li>

<blockquote>
<p>To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the
generic <em>lifetime</em> parameters inside angle brackets between the function name
and the parameter list, just as we did with generic <em>type</em> parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want the signature to express the following constraint:</p>
<ul>
<li>the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid.</li>
<li>This is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value.</li>

<p>We’ll name the lifetime <code>'a</code> and then add it to each reference, as shown in Listing 10-21.</p>

<p>This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the
<code>main</code> function in Listing 10-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime <code>'a</code>, the function
takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as
long as lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function signature also tells Rust that the string
slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the
<code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values
referred to by the function arguments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature,
we’re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned.</li>
<li>Rather,
we’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t
adhere to these constraints.</li>
<li>Note that the <code>longest</code> function doesn’t need to
know exactly how long <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will live, only that some scope can be
substituted for <code>'a</code> that will satisfy this signature.</li>
</ol>
<p>When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function
signature, not in the function body.</p>
<p>The lifetime annotations become part of
the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having
function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust
compiler does can be simpler.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If there’s a problem with the way a function is
annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of
our code and the constraints more precisely.</li>
<li>If, instead, the Rust compiler
made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes
to be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps
away from the cause of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we pass concrete references to <code>longest</code>, the concrete lifetime that is
substituted for <code>'a</code> is the part of the scope of <code>x</code> that overlaps with the
scope of <code>y</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, the generic lifetime <code>'a</code> will get the concrete
lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because
we’ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>,
the returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the
lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the <code>longest</code> function by
passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes.</p>
<p>Listing 10-22 is a straightforward example.</p>

<p>The error shows that for <code>result</code> to be valid for the <code>println!</code> statement,
<code>string2</code> would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust knows
this because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return
values using the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As humans, we can look at this code and see that <code>string1</code> is longer than
<code>string2</code> and therefore <code>result</code> will contain a reference to <code>string1</code>.</p>
<p>Because <code>string1</code> has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to <code>string1</code> will
still be valid for the <code>println!</code> statement.</p>
<p>However, the compiler can’t see that the reference is valid in this case.</p>
<p>We’ve told Rust that the lifetime of
the reference returned by the <code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of
the lifetimes of the references passed in.</p>
<p>Therefore, the borrow checker
disallows the code in Listing 10-23 as possibly having an invalid reference.</p>
<p>Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the
references passed in to the <code>longest</code> function and how the returned reference
is used.</p>

<p>After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers
were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular
situations.</p>
<p>These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic
patterns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler’s code so
the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn’t
need explicit annotations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This piece of Rust history is relevant because it’s possible that more
deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler.</p>
<p>In the future,
even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.</p>
<h3 id="three-rules-is-for-compiler-not-programmer"><a class="header" href="#three-rules-is-for-compiler-not-programmer">Three Rules is for compiler, not programmer</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references are called the
<em>lifetime elision rules</em>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>These aren’t rules for programmers to follow;</li>
<li>they’re a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code
fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The elision rules don’t provide full inference.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If Rust deterministically
applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the
references have, the compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining
references should be.</li>
<li>Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error
that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.</li>
<li>Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called <em>input lifetimes</em>, and
lifetimes on return values are called <em>output lifetimes</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-the-three-rules"><a class="header" href="#what-the-three-rules">What the three rules</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references
when there aren’t explicit annotations:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The first rule applies to input lifetimes,</li>
<li>and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If the
compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for
which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules apply to <code>fn</code> definitions as well as <code>impl</code> blocks.</p>
<p>The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each
parameter that’s a reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)</code>;</li>
<li>a function with two
parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32, y: &amp;'b i32)</code>; and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that
lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32) -&gt; &amp;'a i32</code>.</p>
<p>The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but
one of them is <code>&amp;self</code> or <code>&amp;mut self</code> because this is a method, the lifetime of
<code>self</code> is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.</p>
<p>This third rule makes
methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s pretend we’re the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll apply these rules to figure out the
lifetimes of the references in the signature of the <code>first_word</code> function in

<p>Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter
gets its own lifetime.</p>

<p>We’ll call it <em>’a</em> as usual, so now the signature is this:</p>

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime.</p>
<p>The second rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to
the output lifetime, so the signature is now this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the
compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate
the lifetimes in this function signature.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example, this time using the <code>longest</code> function that had
no lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we
have two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can see that the second rule doesn’t apply because there is more than one
input lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third rule doesn’t apply either, because <code>longest</code> is a
function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After
working through all three rules, we still haven’t figured out what the return
type’s lifetime is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in
Listing 10-20:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still
couldn’t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p>
<p>Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we’ll look at
lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don’t have to
annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p>
<h2 id="lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions">Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</a></h2>
<p>When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as
that of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11.</p>
<p>Where we declare and
use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they’re related to the struct
fields or the method parameters and return values.</p>
<p>Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the <code>impl</code>
keyword and then used after the struct’s name, because those lifetimes are part
of the struct’s type.</p>
<p>In method signatures inside the <code>impl</code> block, references might be tied to the
lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent. In
addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations
aren’t necessary in method signatures.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some examples using the
struct named <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that we defined in Listing 10-24.</p>

<li>
<p>There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule
and gives both <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>announcement</code> their own lifetimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, because
one of the parameters is <code>&amp;self</code>, the return type gets the lifetime of <code>&amp;self</code>,
and all lifetimes have been accounted for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-static-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#the-static-lifetime">The Static Lifetime</a></h2>
<p>One special lifetime we need to discuss is <code>'static</code>, which denotes that the
affected reference <em>can</em> live for the entire duration of the program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All
string literals have the <code>'static</code> lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s: &amp; 'static str = &quot;I have a static lifetime.&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The text of this string is stored directly in the program’s binary, which
is always available.</p>
<p>Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is
<code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>You might see suggestions to use the <code>'static</code> lifetime in error messages. But
before specifying <code>'static</code> as the lifetime for a reference, think about
whether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your
program or not, and whether you want it to.</p>
<p>Most of the time, an error message
suggesting the <code>'static</code> lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling
reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes.</p>
<p>In such cases, the solution
is fixing those problems, not specifying the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p>

<p>This is the <code>longest</code> function from Listing 10-21 that returns the longer of

<p>But now it has an extra parameter named <code>ann</code> of the generic
type <code>T</code>, which can be filled in by any type that implements the <code>Display</code>
trait as specified by the <code>where</code> clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extra parameter will be printed
using <code>{}</code>, which is why the <code>Display</code> trait bound is necessary.</p>
<p>Because
lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter
<code>'a</code> and the generic type parameter <code>T</code> go in the same list inside the angle

<h2 id="summary-10"><a class="header" href="#summary-10">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We covered a lot in this chapter!</p>
<p>Now that you know about generic type
parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you’re
ready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations.</p>
<p>Generic type parameters let you apply the code to different types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traits and
trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they’ll have the
behavior the code needs.</li>
<li>You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure
that this flexible code won’t have any dangling references.</li>
<li>And all of this
analysis happens at compile time, which doesn’t affect runtime performance!</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in
this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use
traits.</li>
<li>There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations
that you will only need in very advanced scenarios;</li>
<li>for those, you should read
the <a href="../reference/index.html">Rust Reference</a>. But next, you’ll learn how to write tests in
Rust so you can make sure your code is working the way it should.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing-automated-tests"><a class="header" href="#writing-automated-tests">Writing Automated Tests</a></h1>
<p>In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that
“Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but
it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we
shouldn’t try to test as much as we can!</p>
<p>Correctness in our programs is the extent to which our code does what we intend
it to do. Rust is designed with a high degree of concern about the correctness
of programs, but correctness is complex and not easy to prove. Rust’s type
system shoulders a huge part of this burden, but the type system cannot catch
everything. As such, Rust includes support for writing automated software tests.</p>
<p>Say we write a function <code>add_two</code> that adds 2 to whatever number is passed to
it. This function’s signature accepts an integer as a parameter and returns an
integer as a result. When we implement and compile that function, Rust does all
the type checking and borrow checking that you’ve learned so far to ensure
that, for instance, we aren’t passing a <code>String</code> value or an invalid reference
to this function. But Rust <em>can’t</em> check that this function will do precisely
what we intend, which is return the parameter plus 2 rather than, say, the
parameter plus 10 or the parameter minus 50! That’s where tests come in.</p>
<p>We can write tests that assert, for example, that when we pass <code>3</code> to the
<code>add_two</code> function, the returned value is <code>5</code>. We can run these tests whenever
we make changes to our code to make sure any existing correct behavior has not
changed.</p>
<p>Testing is a complex skill: although we can’t cover every detail about how to
write good tests in one chapter, we’ll discuss the mechanics of Rust’s testing
facilities. We’ll talk about the annotations and macros available to you when
writing your tests, the default behavior and options provided for running your
tests, and how to organize tests into unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="how-to-write-tests"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-tests">How to Write Tests</a></h2>
<p>Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three
actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up any needed data or state.</li>
<li>Run the code you want to test.</li>
<li>Assert the results are what you expect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that
take these actions, which include the <code>test</code> attribute, a few macros, and the
<code>should_panic</code> attribute.</p>
<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-test-function"><a class="header" href="#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function">The Anatomy of a Test Function</a></h3>
<p>At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the <code>test</code>
attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is
the <code>derive</code> attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function
into a test function, add <code>#[test]</code> on the line before <code>fn</code>. When you run your
tests with the <code>cargo test</code> command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs
the annotated functions and reports on whether each
test function passes or fails.</p>
<p>Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test
function in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a
template for writing your tests so you don’t have to look up the exact
structure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many
additional test functions and as many test modules as you want!</p>
<p>We’ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template
test before we actually test any code. Then we’ll write some real-world tests
that call some code that we’ve written and assert that its behavior is correct.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new library project called <code>adder</code> that will add two numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new adder --lib
     Created library `adder` project
$ cd adder
</code></pre>
<p>The contents of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file in your <code>adder</code> library should look like
Listing 11-1.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests
rm -rf listing-11-01
cargo new listing-11-01 --lib --name adder
cd listing-11-01

cd ../../..
-->
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-1: The test module and function generated
automatically by <code>cargo new</code></span></p>
<p>For now, let’s ignore the top two lines and focus on the function. Note the
<code>#[test]</code> annotation: this attribute indicates this is a test function, so the
test runner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test
functions in the <code>tests</code> module to help set up common scenarios or perform
common operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.</p>
<p>The example function body uses the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro to assert that <code>result</code>,
which contains the result of adding 2 and 2, equals 4. This assertion serves as
an example of the format for a typical test. Let’s run it to see that this test
passes.</p>
<p>The <code>cargo test</code> command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing
11-2.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-2: The output from running the automatically
generated test</span></p>
<p>Cargo compiled and ran the test. We see the line <code>running 1 test</code>. The next
line shows the name of the generated test function, called <code>it_works</code>, and that
the result of running that test is <code>ok</code>. The overall summary <code>test result: ok.</code>
means that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads <code>1 passed; 0 failed</code> totals the number of tests that passed or failed.</p>
<p>It’s possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn’t run in a particular
instance; we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#ignoring-some-tests-unless-specifically-requested">“Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically
Requested”</a><!-- ignore --> section later in this chapter. Because we
haven’t done that here, the summary shows <code>0 ignored</code>. We can also pass an
argument to the <code>cargo test</code> command to run only tests whose name matches a
string; this is called <em>filtering</em> and we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#running-a-subset-of-tests-by-name">“Running a
Subset of Tests by Name”</a><!-- ignore --> section. We also haven’t
filtered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows <code>0 filtered out</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>0 measured</code> statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance.
Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See
<a href="../unstable-book/library-features/test.html">the documentation about benchmark tests</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>The next part of the test output starting at <code>Doc-tests adder</code> is for the
results of any documentation tests. We don’t have any documentation tests yet,
but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API documentation.
This feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync! We’ll discuss how to
write documentation tests in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#documentation-comments-as-tests">“Documentation Comments as
Tests”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 14. For now, we’ll
ignore the <code>Doc-tests</code> output.</p>
<p>Let’s start to customize the test to our own needs. First change the name of
the <code>it_works</code> function to a different name, such as <code>exploration</code>, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then run <code>cargo test</code> again. The output now shows <code>exploration</code> instead of
<code>it_works</code>:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ll add another test, but this time we’ll make a test that fails! Tests
fail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new
thread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is
marked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic
is to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. Enter the new test as a function named
<code>another</code>, so your <em>src/lib.rs</em> file looks like Listing 11-3.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>ok</code>, the line <code>test tests::another</code> shows <code>FAILED</code>. Two new

line 10 in the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file. The next section lists just the names of all
the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of
detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just
that test to more easily debug it; we’ll talk more about ways to run tests in
the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#controlling-how-tests-are-run">“Controlling How Tests Are Run”</a><!-- ignore

<p>The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is <code>FAILED</code>. We
had one test pass and one test fail.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios,
let’s look at some macros other than <code>panic!</code> that are useful in tests.</p>
<h3 id="checking-results-with-the-assert-macro"><a class="header" href="#checking-results-with-the-assert-macro">Checking Results with the <code>assert!</code> Macro</a></h3>
<p>The <code>assert!</code> macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want
to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to <code>true</code>. We give the
<code>assert!</code> macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is
<code>true</code>, nothing happens and the test passes. If the value is <code>false</code>, the
<code>assert!</code> macro calls <code>panic!</code> to cause the test to fail. Using the <code>assert!</code>
macro helps us check that our code is functioning in the way we intend.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a <code>Rectangle</code> struct and a <code>can_hold</code>
method, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let’s put this code in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, then write some tests for it using the <code>assert!</code> macro.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.width &gt; other.width &amp;&amp; self.height &gt; other.height
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-5: Using the <code>Rectangle</code> struct and its
<code>can_hold</code> method from Chapter 5</span></p>
<p>The <code>can_hold</code> method returns a Boolean, which means it’s a perfect use case
for the <code>assert!</code> macro. In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the
<code>can_hold</code> method by creating a <code>Rectangle</code> instance that has a width of 8 and
a height of 7 and asserting that it can hold another <code>Rectangle</code> instance that
has a width of 5 and a height of 1.</p>

The <code>tests</code> module is a regular module that follows the usual visibility rules

a glob here so anything we define in the outer module is available to this

<p>We’ve named our test <code>larger_can_hold_smaller</code>, and we’ve created the two
<code>Rectangle</code> instances that we need. Then we called the <code>assert!</code> macro and
passed it the result of calling <code>larger.can_hold(&amp;smaller)</code>. This expression is
supposed to return <code>true</code>, so our test should pass. Let’s find out!</p>

<p>A common way to verify functionality is to test for equality between the result
of the code under test and the value you expect the code to return. You could
do this using the <code>assert!</code> macro and passing it an expression using the <code>==</code>
operator. However, this is such a common test that the standard library
provides a pair of macros—<code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code>—to perform this test
more conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or
inequality, respectively. They’ll also print the two values if the assertion
fails, which makes it easier to see <em>why</em> the test failed; conversely, the
<code>assert!</code> macro only indicates that it got a <code>false</code> value for the <code>==</code>
expression, without printing the values that led to the <code>false</code> value.</p>
<p>In Listing 11-7, we write a function named <code>add_two</code> that adds <code>2</code> to its
parameter, then we test this function using the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Our test caught the bug! The <code>it_adds_two</code> test failed, and the message tells
us that the assertion that fails was <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code>
and what the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> values are. This message helps us start
debugging: the <code>left</code> argument was <code>4</code> but the <code>right</code> argument, where we had
<code>add_two(2)</code>, was <code>5</code>. You can imagine that this would be especially helpful
when we have a lot of tests going on.</p>
<p>Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality
assertion functions are called <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>, and the order in which
we specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they’re called <code>left</code> and
<code>right</code>, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value
the code produces doesn’t matter. We could write the assertion in this test as
<code>assert_eq!(add_two(2), 4)</code>, which would result in the same failure message
that displays <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>assert_ne!</code> macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and
fail if they’re equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we’re not sure
what a value <em>will</em> be, but we know what the value definitely <em>shouldn’t</em> be.
For example, if we’re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input
in some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of
the week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the
output of the function is not equal to the input.</p>
<p>Under the surface, the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros use the operators
<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their
arguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must
implement the <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code> traits. All primitive types and most of
the standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that
you define yourself, you’ll need to implement <code>PartialEq</code> to assert equality of
those types. You’ll also need to implement <code>Debug</code> to print the values when the
assertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in
Listing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the
<code>#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]</code> annotation to your struct or enum definition. See
Appendix C, <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable Traits,”</a><!-- ignore --> for more
details about these and other derivable traits.</p>
<h3 id="adding-custom-failure-messages"><a class="header" href="#adding-custom-failure-messages">Adding Custom Failure Messages</a></h3>
<p>You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as
optional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any
arguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the
<code>format!</code> macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro">“Concatenation with the <code>+</code>
Operator or the <code>format!</code>
Macro”</a><!-- ignore -->
section), so you can pass a format string that contains <code>{}</code> placeholders and
values to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful for documenting
what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better idea of what
the problem is with the code.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and we
want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    format!(&quot;Hello {}!&quot;, name)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting(&quot;Carol&quot;);
        assert!(result.contains(&quot;Carol&quot;));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re
pretty sure the <code>Hello</code> text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We
decided we don’t want to have to update the test when the requirements change,
so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the
<code>greeting</code> function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of the
input parameter.</p>
<p>Now let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing <code>greeting</code> to exclude
<code>name</code> to see what the default test failure looks like:</p>

<p>In addition to checking return values, it’s important to check that our code
handles error conditions as we expect. For example, consider the <code>Guess</code> type
that we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13. Other code that uses <code>Guess</code>
depends on the guarantee that <code>Guess</code> instances will contain only values
between 1 and 100. We can write a test that ensures that attempting to create a

<p>We don’t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test
function, we see that it’s annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code>. The failure we got
means that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.</p>
<p>Tests that use <code>should_panic</code> can be imprecise. A <code>should_panic</code> test would
pass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one we were
expecting. To make <code>should_panic</code> tests more precise, we can add an optional
<code>expected</code> parameter to the <code>should_panic</code> attribute. The test harness will
make sure that the failure message contains the provided text. For example,
consider the modified code for <code>Guess</code> in Listing 11-9 where the <code>new</code> function
panics with different messages depending on whether the value is too small or
too large.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-9: Testing for a <code>panic!</code> with a panic message
containing a specified substring</span></p>
<p>This test will pass because the value we put in the <code>should_panic</code> attribute’s
<code>expected</code> parameter is a substring of the message that the <code>Guess::new</code>
function panics with. We could have specified the entire panic message that we
expect, which in this case would be <code>Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got 200.</code> What you choose to specify depends on how much of the panic
message is unique or dynamic and how precise you want your test to be. In this
case, a substring of the panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the
test function executes the <code>else if value &gt; 100</code> case.</p>
<p>To see what happens when a <code>should_panic</code> test with an <code>expected</code> message

<p>The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected,
but the panic message did not include the expected string <code>'Guess value must be less than or equal to 100'</code>. The panic message that we did get in this case was
<code>Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got 200.</code> Now we can start
figuring out where our bug is!</p>
<h3 id="using-resultt-e-in-tests"><a class="header" href="#using-resultt-e-in-tests">Using <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in Tests</a></h3>
<p>Our tests so far all panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>! Here’s the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> and return an <code>Err</code> instead of panicking:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; {
        if 2 + 2 == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from(&quot;two plus two does not equal four&quot;))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>it_works</code> function now has the <code>Result&lt;(), String&gt;</code> return type. In the
body of the function, rather than calling the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro, we return
<code>Ok(())</code> when the test passes and an <code>Err</code> with a <code>String</code> inside when the test
fails.</p>
<p>Writing tests so they return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> enables you to use the question
mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write
tests that should fail if any operation within them returns an <code>Err</code> variant.</p>
<p>You can’t use the <code>#[should_panic]</code> annotation on tests that use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. To assert that an operation returns an <code>Err</code> variant, <em>don’t</em> use the
question mark operator on the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> value. Instead, use
<code>assert!(value.is_err())</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening
when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with <code>cargo test</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="controlling-how-tests-are-run"><a class="header" href="#controlling-how-tests-are-run">Controlling How Tests Are Run</a></h2>
<p>Just as <code>cargo run</code> compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary,
<code>cargo test</code> compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test
binary. The default behavior of the binary produced by <code>cargo test</code> is to run
all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs,
preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the
output related to the test results. You can, however, specify command line
options to change this default behavior.</p>
<p>Some command line options go to <code>cargo test</code>, and some go to the resulting test
binary. To separate these two types of arguments, you list the arguments that
go to <code>cargo test</code> followed by the separator <code>--</code> and then the ones that go to
the test binary. Running <code>cargo test --help</code> displays the options you can use
with <code>cargo test</code>, and running <code>cargo test -- --help</code> displays the options you
can use after the separator.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively"><a class="header" href="#running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively">Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively</a></h3>
<p>When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads,
meaning they finish running faster and you get feedback quicker. Because the
tests are running at the same time, you must make sure your tests don’t depend
on each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment, such as
the current working directory or environment variables.</p>
<p>For example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file on disk
named <em>test-output.txt</em> and writes some data to that file. Then each test reads
the data in that file and asserts that the file contains a particular value,
which is different in each test. Because the tests run at the same time, one
test might overwrite the file in the time between another test writing and
reading the file. The second test will then fail, not because the code is
incorrect but because the tests have interfered with each other while running
in parallel. One solution is to make sure each test writes to a different file;
another solution is to run the tests one at a time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained
control over the number of threads used, you can send the <code>--test-threads</code> flag
and the number of threads you want to use to the test binary. Take a look at
the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1
</code></pre>
<p>We set the number of test threads to <code>1</code>, telling the program not to use any
parallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than running
them in parallel, but the tests won’t interfere with each other if they share
state.</p>
<h3 id="showing-function-output"><a class="header" href="#showing-function-output">Showing Function Output</a></h3>
<p>By default, if a test passes, Rust’s test library captures anything printed to
standard output. For example, if we call <code>println!</code> in a test and the test
passes, we won’t see the <code>println!</code> output in the terminal; we’ll see only the
line that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we’ll see whatever was
printed to standard output with the rest of the failure message.</p>
<p>As an example, Listing 11-10 has a silly function that prints the value of its
parameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a test that fails.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

will be fast. When you’re at a point where it makes sense to check the results
of the <code>ignored</code> tests and you have time to wait for the results, you can run
<code>cargo test -- --ignored</code> instead. If you want to run all tests whether they’re
ignored or not, you can run <code>cargo test -- --include-ignored</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="test-organization"><a class="header" href="#test-organization">Test Organization</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex discipline, and
different people use different terminology and organization. The Rust community
thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration
tests. <em>Unit tests</em> are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation
at a time, and can test private interfaces. <em>Integration tests</em> are entirely
external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external
code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple
modules per test.</p>
<p>Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your
library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.</p>
<h3 id="unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#unit-tests">Unit Tests</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the
rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as
expected. You’ll put unit tests in the <em>src</em> directory in each file with the
code that they’re testing. The convention is to create a module named <code>tests</code>
in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with
<code>cfg(test)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="the-tests-module-and-cfgtest"><a class="header" href="#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest">The Tests Module and <code>#[cfg(test)]</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run
the test code only when you run <code>cargo test</code>, not when you run <code>cargo build</code>.
This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space
in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll
see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need
the <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files
as the code, you’ll use <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> to specify that they shouldn’t be
included in the compiled result.</p>
<p>Recall that when we generated the new <code>adder</code> project in the first section of
this chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute <code>cfg</code>
stands for <em>configuration</em> and tells Rust that the following item should only
be included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the
configuration option is <code>test</code>, which is provided by Rust for compiling and
running tests. By using the <code>cfg</code> attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only
if we actively run the tests with <code>cargo test</code>. This includes any helper
functions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions
annotated with <code>#[test]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="testing-private-functions"><a class="header" href="#testing-private-functions">Testing Private Functions</a></h4>
<p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private
functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or
impossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you
adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.
Consider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function <code>internal_adder</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn add_two(a: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-12: Testing a private function</span></p>
<p>Note that the <code>internal_adder</code> function is not marked as <code>pub</code>. Tests are just
Rust code, and the <code>tests</code> module is just another module. As we discussed in
the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore -->
section, items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. In
this test, we bring all of the <code>test</code> module’s parent’s items into scope with
<code>use super::*</code>, and then the test can call <code>internal_adder</code>. If you don’t think
private functions should be tested, there’s nothing in Rust that will compel
you to do so.</p>
<h3 id="integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#integration-tests">Integration Tests</a></h3>
<p>In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your
library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call
functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test
whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that
work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test
coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration
tests, you first need a <em>tests</em> directory.</p>
<h4 id="the-tests-directory"><a class="header" href="#the-tests-directory">The <em>tests</em> Directory</a></h4>
<p>We create a <em>tests</em> directory at the top level of our project directory, next
to <em>src</em>. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We
can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the
files as an individual crate.</p>
<p>Let’s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, make a <em>tests</em> directory, and create a new file named
<em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>. Your directory structure should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs
</code></pre>
<p>Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use adder;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the
<code>adder</code> crate</span></p>
<p>Each file in the <code>tests</code> directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our
library into each test crate’s scope. For that reason we add <code>use adder</code> at the
top of the code, which we didn’t need in the unit tests.</p>
<p>We don’t need to annotate any code in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> with
<code>#[cfg(test)]</code>. Cargo treats the <code>tests</code> directory specially and compiles files
in this directory only when we run <code>cargo test</code>. Run <code>cargo test</code> now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo test

</code></pre>
<p>The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and
the doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections
will not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won’t be any output
for integration and doc tests because those tests will only be run if all unit
tests are passing.</p>
<p>The first section for the unit tests is the same as we’ve been seeing: one line
for each unit test (one named <code>internal</code> that we added in Listing 11-12) and
then a summary line for the unit tests.</p>
<p>The integration tests section starts with the line <code>Running tests/integration_test.rs</code>. Next, there is a line for each test function in
that integration test and a summary line for the results of the integration
test just before the <code>Doc-tests adder</code> section starts.</p>
<p>Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the
<em>tests</em> directory, there will be more integration test sections.</p>
<p>We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test
function’s name as an argument to <code>cargo test</code>. To run all the tests in a
particular integration test file, use the <code>--test</code> argument of <code>cargo test</code>
followed by the name of the file:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This command runs only the tests in the <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> file.</p>
<h4 id="submodules-in-integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#submodules-in-integration-tests">Submodules in Integration Tests</a></h4>
<p>As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the
<em>tests</em> directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test
functions by the functionality they’re testing. As mentioned earlier, each file
in the <em>tests</em> directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful
for creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users will be
using your crate. However, this means files in the <em>tests</em> directory don’t
share the same behavior as files in <em>src</em> do, as you learned in Chapter 7
regarding how to separate code into modules and files.</p>
<p>The different behavior of <em>tests</em> directory files is most noticeable when you
have a set of helper functions to use in multiple integration test files and
you try to follow the steps in the <a href="ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html">“Separating Modules into Different
Files”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 7 to
extract them into a common module. For example, if we create <em>tests/common.rs</em>
and place a function named <code>setup</code> in it, we can add some code to <code>setup</code> that
we want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/common.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the tests again, we’ll see a new section in the test output for the
<em>common.rs</em> file, even though this file doesn’t contain any test functions nor
did we call the <code>setup</code> function from anywhere:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Having <code>common</code> appear in the test results with <code>running 0 tests</code> displayed for
it is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other
integration test files.</p>
<p>To avoid having <code>common</code> appear in the test output, instead of creating
<em>tests/common.rs</em>, we’ll create <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>. The project directory
now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── common
    │   └── mod.rs
    └── integration_test.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we
mentioned in the <a href="ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#alternate-file-paths">“Alternate File Paths”</a><!-- ignore --> section of
Chapter 7. Naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat the <code>common</code> module
as an integration test file. When we move the <code>setup</code> function code into
<em>tests/common/mod.rs</em> and delete the <em>tests/common.rs</em> file, the section in the
test output will no longer appear. Files in subdirectories of the <em>tests</em>
directory don’t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test
output.</p>
<p>After we’ve created <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>, we can use it from any of the
integration test files as a module. Here’s an example of calling the <code>setup</code>
function from the <code>it_adds_two</code> test in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use adder;

mod common;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>mod common;</code> declaration is the same as the module declaration
we demonstrated in Listing 7-21. Then in the test function, we can call the
<code>common::setup()</code> function.</p>
<h4 id="integration-tests-for-binary-crates"><a class="header" href="#integration-tests-for-binary-crates">Integration Tests for Binary Crates</a></h4>
<p>If our project is a binary crate that only contains a <em>src/main.rs</em> file and
doesn’t have a <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, we can’t create integration tests in the
<em>tests</em> directory and bring functions defined in the <em>src/main.rs</em> file into
scope with a <code>use</code> statement. Only library crates expose functions that other
crates can use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a
straightforward <em>src/main.rs</em> file that calls logic that lives in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file. Using that structure, integration tests <em>can</em> test the
library crate with <code>use</code> to make the important functionality available.
If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t
need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="summary-11"><a class="header" href="#summary-11">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to
ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit tests
exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private
implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library
work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code
in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and
ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to
reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.</p>
<p>Let’s combine the knowledge you learned in this chapter and in previous
chapters to work on a project!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="an-io-project-building-a-command-line-program"><a class="header" href="#an-io-project-building-a-command-line-program">An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program</a></h1>
<p>This chapter is a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We’ll build a command line
tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice some of
the Rust concepts you now have under your belt.</p>
<p>Rust’s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make it
an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our project, we’ll
make our own version of the classic command line search tool <code>grep</code>
(<strong>g</strong>lobally search a <strong>r</strong>egular <strong>e</strong>xpression and <strong>p</strong>rint). In the
simplest use case, <code>grep</code> searches a specified file for a specified string. To
do so, <code>grep</code> takes as its arguments a file path and a string. Then it reads
the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints
those lines.</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll show how to make our command line tool use the terminal
features that many other command line tools use. We’ll read the value of an
environment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our tool.
We’ll also print error messages to the standard error console stream (<code>stderr</code>)
instead of standard output (<code>stdout</code>), so, for example, the user can redirect
successful output to a file while still seeing error messages onscreen.</p>
<p>One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully
featured, very fast version of <code>grep</code>, called <code>ripgrep</code>. By comparison, our
version will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some of the
background knowledge you need to understand a real-world project such as
<code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>Our <code>grep</code> project will combine a number of concepts you’ve learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing code (using what you learned about modules in <a href="ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html">Chapter 7</a><!--
    ignore -->)</li>
<li>Using vectors and strings (collections, <a href="ch08-00-common-collections.html">Chapter 8</a><!-- ignore -->)</li>
<li>Handling errors (<a href="ch09-00-error-handling.html">Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->)</li>
<li>Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (<a href="ch10-00-generics.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore
    -->)</li>
<li>Writing tests (<a href="ch11-00-testing.html">Chapter 11</a><!-- ignore -->)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which
Chapters <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">13</a><!-- ignore --> and <a href="ch17-00-oop.html">17</a><!-- ignore --> will cover in
detail.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="accepting-command-line-arguments"><a class="header" href="#accepting-command-line-arguments">Accepting Command Line Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Let’s create a new project with, as always, <code>cargo new</code>. We’ll call our project
<code>minigrep</code> to distinguish it from the <code>grep</code> tool that you might already have
on your system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
</code></pre>
<p>The first task is to make <code>minigrep</code> accept its two command line arguments: the
file path and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our
program with <code>cargo run</code>, two hyphens to indicate the following arguments are
for our program rather than for <code>cargo</code>, a string to search for, and a path to
a file to search in, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, the program generated by <code>cargo new</code> cannot process arguments we
give it. Some existing libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> can help
with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but because you’re
just learning this concept, let’s implement this capability ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#reading-the-argument-values">Reading the Argument Values</a></h3>
<p>To enable <code>minigrep</code> to read the values of command line arguments we pass to
it, we’ll need the <code>std::env::args</code> function provided in Rust’s standard
library. This function returns an iterator of the command line arguments passed
to <code>minigrep</code>. We’ll cover iterators fully in <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore
-->. For now, you only need to know two details about iterators: iterators
produce a series of values, and we can call the <code>collect</code> method on an iterator
to turn it into a collection, such as a vector, that contains all the elements
the iterator produces.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 12-1 allows your <code>minigrep</code> program to read any command
line arguments passed to it and then collect the values into a vector.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
    dbg!(args);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-1: Collecting the command line arguments into
a vector and printing them</span></p>
<p>First, we bring the <code>std::env</code> module into scope with a <code>use</code> statement so we
can use its <code>args</code> function. Notice that the <code>std::env::args</code> function is
nested in two levels of modules. As we discussed in <a href="ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#creating-idiomatic-use-paths">Chapter
7</a><!-- ignore -->, in cases where the desired function is
nested in more than one module, we’ve chosen to bring the parent module into
scope rather than the function. By doing so, we can easily use other functions
from <code>std::env</code>. It’s also less ambiguous than adding <code>use std::env::args</code> and
then calling the function with just <code>args</code>, because <code>args</code> might easily be
mistaken for a function that’s defined in the current module.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode"><a class="header" href="#the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode">The <code>args</code> Function and Invalid Unicode</a></h3>
<p>Note that <code>std::env::args</code> will panic if any argument contains invalid
Unicode. If your program needs to accept arguments containing invalid
Unicode, use <code>std::env::args_os</code> instead. That function returns an iterator
that produces <code>OsString</code> values instead of <code>String</code> values. We’ve chosen to
use <code>std::env::args</code> here for simplicity, because <code>OsString</code> values differ
per platform and are more complex to work with than <code>String</code> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first line of <code>main</code>, we call <code>env::args</code>, and we immediately use
<code>collect</code> to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values produced
by the iterator. We can use the <code>collect</code> function to create many kinds of
collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of <code>args</code> to specify that we
want a vector of strings. Although we very rarely need to annotate types in
Rust, <code>collect</code> is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust
isn’t able to infer the kind of collection you want.</p>
<p>Finally, we print the vector using the debug macro. Let’s try running the code
first with no arguments and then with two arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
[src/main.rs:5] args = [
    &quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- needle haystack
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.57s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep needle haystack`
[src/main.rs:5] args = [
    &quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;,
    &quot;needle&quot;,
    &quot;haystack&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the first value in the vector is <code>&quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;</code>, which
is the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments list in
C, letting programs use the name by which they were invoked in their execution.
It’s often convenient to have access to the program name in case you want to
print it in messages or change behavior of the program based on what command
line alias was used to invoke the program. But for the purposes of this
chapter, we’ll ignore it and save only the two arguments we need.</p>
<h3 id="saving-the-argument-values-in-variables"><a class="header" href="#saving-the-argument-values-in-variables">Saving the Argument Values in Variables</a></h3>
<p>The program is currently able to access the values specified as command line
arguments. Now we need to save the values of the two arguments in variables so
we can use the values throughout the rest of the program. We do that in Listing
12-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust should_panic noplayground">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let file_path = &amp;args[2];

    println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, query);
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, file_path);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-2: Creating variables to hold the query
argument and file path argument</span></p>
<p>As we saw when we printed the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at <code>args[0]</code>, so we’re starting arguments at index <code>1</code>. The
first argument <code>minigrep</code> takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable <code>query</code>. The second argument
will be the file path, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable <code>file_path</code>.</p>
<p>We temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the code is
working as we intend. Let’s run this program again with the arguments <code>test</code>
and <code>sample.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- test sample.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep test sample.txt`
Searching for test
In file sample.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Great, the program is working! The values of the arguments we need are being
saved into the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal
with certain potential erroneous situations, such as when the user provides no
arguments; for now, we’ll ignore that situation and work on adding file-reading
capabilities instead.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add functionality to read the file specified in the <code>file_path</code>
argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with: we’ll use a file with a
small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3
has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file called
<em>poem.txt</em> at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m Nobody!

</code></pre>
<p>Great! The code read and then printed the contents of the file. But the code
has a few flaws. At the moment, the <code>main</code> function has multiple
responsibilities: generally, functions are clearer and easier to maintain if
each function is responsible for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re
not handling errors as well as we could. The program is still small, so these
flaws aren’t a big problem, but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix
them cleanly. It’s good practice to begin refactoring early on when developing
a program, because it’s much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code. We’ll
do that next.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling">Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling</a></h2>
<p>To improve our program, we’ll fix four problems that have to do with the
program’s structure and how it’s handling potential errors. First, our <code>main</code>
function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and reads files. As our
program grows, the number of separate tasks the <code>main</code> function handles will
increase. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to
reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its
parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for
one task.</p>
<p>This issue also ties into the second problem: although <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code>
are configuration variables to our program, variables like <code>contents</code> are used
to perform the program’s logic. The longer <code>main</code> becomes, the more variables
we’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder
it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group the
configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.</p>
<p>The third problem is that we’ve used <code>expect</code> to print an error message when
reading the file fails, but the error message just prints <code>Should have been able to read the file</code>. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for
example, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it.
Right now, regardless of the situation, we’d print the same error message for
everything, which wouldn’t give the user any information!</p>
<p>Fourth, we use <code>expect</code> repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the user
runs our program without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an <code>index out of bounds</code> error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem. It would
be best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future maintainers
had only one place to consult the code if the error-handling logic needed to
change. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that
we’re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.</p>
<p>Let’s address these four problems by refactoring our project.</p>
<h3 id="separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects"><a class="header" href="#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects">Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects</a></h3>
<p>The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to
the <code>main</code> function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust
community has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a
binary program when <code>main</code> starts getting large. This process has the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split your program into a <em>main.rs</em> and a <em>lib.rs</em> and move your program’s
logic to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
<li>As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in
<em>main.rs</em>.</li>
<li>When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it
from <em>main.rs</em> and move it to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The responsibilities that remain in the <code>main</code> function after this process
should be limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values</li>
<li>Setting up any other configuration</li>
<li>Calling a <code>run</code> function in <em>lib.rs</em></li>
<li>Handling the error if <code>run</code> returns an error</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is about separating concerns: <em>main.rs</em> handles running the
program, and <em>lib.rs</em> handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you
can’t test the <code>main</code> function directly, this structure lets you test all of
your program’s logic by moving it into functions in <em>lib.rs</em>. The code that
remains in <em>main.rs</em> will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading
it. Let’s rework our program by following this process.</p>
<h4 id="extracting-the-argument-parser"><a class="header" href="#extracting-the-argument-parser">Extracting the Argument Parser</a></h4>
<p>We’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that
<code>main</code> will call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to
<em>src/lib.rs</em>. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of <code>main</code> that calls a new
function <code>parse_config</code>, which we’ll define in <em>src/main.rs</em> for the moment.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

fn parse_config(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; (&amp;str, &amp;str) {
    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let file_path = &amp;args[2];

    (query, file_path)
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-5: Extracting a <code>parse_config</code> function from
<code>main</code></span></p>
<p>We’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of
assigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable <code>query</code> and the
argument value at index 2 to the variable <code>file_path</code> within the <code>main</code>
function, we pass the whole vector to the <code>parse_config</code> function. The
<code>parse_config</code> function then holds the logic that determines which argument
goes in which variable and passes the values back to <code>main</code>. We still create
the <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables in <code>main</code>, but <code>main</code> no longer has the
responsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables
correspond.</p>
<p>This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re refactoring
in small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to
verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress
often, to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.</p>
<h4 id="grouping-configuration-values"><a class="header" href="#grouping-configuration-values">Grouping Configuration Values</a></h4>
<p>We can take another small step to improve the <code>parse_config</code> function further.
At the moment, we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that
tuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have
the right abstraction yet.</p>
<p>Another indicator that shows there’s room for improvement is the <code>config</code> part
of <code>parse_config</code>, which implies that the two values we return are related and
are both part of one configuration value. We’re not currently conveying this
meaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into
a tuple; we’ll instead put the two values into one struct and give each of the
struct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future
maintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each
other and what their purpose is.</p>
<p>Listing 12-6 shows the improvements to the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>

    Config { query, file_path }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-6: Refactoring <code>parse_config</code> to return an
instance of a <code>Config</code> struct</span></p>
<p>We’ve added a struct named <code>Config</code> defined to have fields named <code>query</code> and
<code>file_path</code>. The signature of <code>parse_config</code> now indicates that it returns a
<code>Config</code> value. In the body of <code>parse_config</code>, where we used to return
string slices that reference <code>String</code> values in <code>args</code>, we now define <code>Config</code>
to contain owned <code>String</code> values. The <code>args</code> variable in <code>main</code> is the owner of
the argument values and is only letting the <code>parse_config</code> function borrow
them, which means we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if <code>Config</code> tried to take
ownership of the values in <code>args</code>.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we could manage the <code>String</code> data; the easiest,
though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the <code>clone</code> method on the values.
This will make a full copy of the data for the <code>Config</code> instance to own, which
takes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data.
However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we
don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance,
giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-trade-offs-of-using-clone"><a class="header" href="#the-trade-offs-of-using-clone">The Trade-Offs of Using <code>clone</code></a></h3>
<p>There’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using <code>clone</code> to fix
ownership problems because of its runtime cost. In
<a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->, you’ll learn how to use more efficient
methods in this type of situation. But for now, it’s okay to copy a few
strings to continue making progress because you’ll make these copies only
once and your file path and query string are very small. It’s better to have
a working program that’s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize code
on your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it’ll be
easier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it’s
perfectly acceptable to call <code>clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve updated <code>main</code> so it places the instance of <code>Config</code> returned by
<code>parse_config</code> into a variable named <code>config</code>, and we updated the code that
previously used the separate <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables so it now uses
the fields on the <code>Config</code> struct instead.</p>
<p>Now our code more clearly conveys that <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> are related and
that their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that
uses these values knows to find them in the <code>config</code> instance in the fields
named for their purpose.</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-constructor-for-config"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-constructor-for-config">Creating a Constructor for <code>Config</code></a></h4>
<p>So far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line
arguments from <code>main</code> and placed it in the <code>parse_config</code> function. Doing so
helped us to see that the <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> values were related and that
relationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a <code>Config</code> struct to
name the related purpose of <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> and to be able to return the
values’ names as struct field names from the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>
<p>So now that the purpose of the <code>parse_config</code> function is to create a <code>Config</code>
instance, we can change <code>parse_config</code> from a plain function to a function
named <code>new</code> that is associated with the <code>Config</code> struct. Making this change
will make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the
standard library, such as <code>String</code>, by calling <code>String::new</code>. Similarly, by
changing <code>parse_config</code> into a <code>new</code> function associated with <code>Config</code>, we’ll
be able to create instances of <code>Config</code> by calling <code>Config::new</code>. Listing 12-7
shows the changes we need to make.</p>

<p>This output is better: we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also
have extraneous information we don’t want to give to our users. Perhaps using
the technique we used in Listing 9-13 isn’t the best to use here: a call to
<code>panic!</code> is more appropriate for a programming problem than a usage problem,
<a href="ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html#guidelines-for-error-handling">as discussed in Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->. Instead,
we’ll use the other technique you learned about in Chapter 9—<a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">returning a

<p>We can instead return a <code>Result</code> value that will contain a <code>Config</code> instance in
the successful case and will describe the problem in the error case. We’re also
going to change the function name from <code>new</code> to <code>build</code> because many
programmers expect <code>new</code> functions to never fail. When <code>Config::build</code> is
communicating to <code>main</code>, we can use the <code>Result</code> type to signal there was a
problem. Then we can change <code>main</code> to convert an <code>Err</code> variant into a more
practical error for our users without the surrounding text about <code>thread 'main'</code> and <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> that a call to <code>panic!</code> causes.</p>

well, which we’ll do in the next listing.</p>

<p>Our <code>build</code> function returns a <code>Result</code> with a <code>Config</code> instance in the success
case and a <code>&amp;'static str</code> in the error case. Our error values will always be
string literals that have the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p>
<p>We’ve made two changes in the body of the function: instead of calling <code>panic!</code>
when the user doesn’t pass enough arguments, we now return an <code>Err</code> value, and
we’ve wrapped the <code>Config</code> return value in an <code>Ok</code>. These changes make the
function conform to its new type signature.</p>
<p>Returning an <code>Err</code> value from <code>Config::build</code> allows the <code>main</code> function to
handle the <code>Result</code> value returned from the <code>build</code> function and exit the
process more cleanly in the error case.</p>

<p>To handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to update

tool with a nonzero error code away from <code>panic!</code> and instead implement it by

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-10: Exiting with an error code if building a
<code>Config</code> fails</span></p>
<p>In this listing, we’ve used a method we haven’t covered in detail yet:
<code>unwrap_or_else</code>, which is defined on <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> by the standard library.
Using <code>unwrap_or_else</code> allows us to define some custom, non-<code>panic!</code> error
handling. If the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, this method’s behavior is similar
to <code>unwrap</code>: it returns the inner value <code>Ok</code> is wrapping. However, if the value
is an <code>Err</code> value, this method calls the code in the <em>closure</em>, which is an
anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. We’ll
cover closures in more detail in <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->. For now,
you just need to know that <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will pass the inner value of the
<code>Err</code>, which in this case is the static string <code>&quot;not enough arguments&quot;</code> that we
added in Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument <code>err</code> that appears
between the vertical pipes. The code in the closure can then use the <code>err</code>
value when it runs.</p>
<p>We’ve added a new <code>use</code> line to bring <code>process</code> from the standard library into
scope. The code in the closure that will be run in the error case is only two
lines: we print the <code>err</code> value and then call <code>process::exit</code>. The
<code>process::exit</code> function will stop the program immediately and return the
number that was passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the
<code>panic!</code>-based handling we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the
extra output. Let’s try it:</p>

the program’s logic. As we stated in <a href="ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.html#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects">“Separation of Concerns for Binary

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-12: Changing the <code>run</code> function to return
<code>Result</code></span></p>
<p>We’ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the return type of
the <code>run</code> function to <code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This function previously
returned the unit type, <code>()</code>, and we keep that as the value returned in the
<code>Ok</code> case.</p>
<p>For the error type, we used the <em>trait object</em> <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> (and we’ve
brought <code>std::error::Error</code> into scope with a <code>use</code> statement at the top).
We’ll cover trait objects in <a href="ch17-00-oop.html">Chapter 17</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, just
know that <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> means the function will return a type that
implements the <code>Error</code> trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type
the return value will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that
may be of different types in different error cases. The <code>dyn</code> keyword is short
for “dynamic.”</p>
<p>Second, we’ve removed the call to <code>expect</code> in favor of the <code>?</code> operator, as we
talked about in <a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator">Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->. Rather than
<code>panic!</code> on an error, <code>?</code> will return the error value from the current function
for the caller to handle.</p>
<p>Third, the <code>run</code> function now returns an <code>Ok</code> value in the success case.
We’ve declared the <code>run</code> function’s success type as <code>()</code> in the signature,
which means we need to wrap the unit type value in the <code>Ok</code> value. This
<code>Ok(())</code> syntax might look a bit strange at first, but using <code>()</code> like this is
the idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling <code>run</code> for its side effects
only; it doesn’t return a value we need.</p>
<p>When you run this code, it will compile but will display a warning:</p>

<p>Rust tells us that our code ignored the <code>Result</code> value and the <code>Result</code> value

not there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that we probably meant to

return a value that we want to <code>unwrap</code> in the same way that <code>Config::build</code>
returns the <code>Config</code> instance. Because <code>run</code> returns <code>()</code> in the success case,

<p>Let’s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would
have been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new code: we’ll
write some tests!</p>

<p>Now that we’ve extracted the logic into <em>src/lib.rs</em> and left the argument
collecting and error handling in <em>src/main.rs</em>, it’s much easier to write tests
for the core functionality of our code. We can call functions directly with
various arguments and check return values without having to call our binary
from the command line.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the <code>minigrep</code> program
using the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you
expect.</li>
<li>Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.</li>
<li>Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests
continue to pass.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 1!</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it’s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code
design. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass
helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.</p>
<p>We’ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do
the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of

<code>search</code>.</p>

<p>Because we don’t need them anymore, let’s remove the <code>println!</code> statements from
<em>src/lib.rs</em> and <em>src/main.rs</em> that we used to check the program’s behavior.
Then, in <em>src/lib.rs</em>, add a <code>tests</code> module with a test function, as we did in
<a href="ch11-01-writing-tests.html#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function">Chapter 11</a><!-- ignore -->. The test function specifies the
behavior we want the <code>search</code> function to have: it will take a query and the
text to search, and it will return only the lines from the text that contain
the query. Listing 12-15 shows this test, which won’t compile yet.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-16: Defining just enough of the <code>search</code>
function so our test will compile</span></p>
<p>Notice that we need to define an explicit lifetime <code>'a</code> in the signature of
<code>search</code> and use that lifetime with the <code>contents</code> argument and the return
value. Recall in <a href="ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore --> that the lifetime
parameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the
return value. In this case, we indicate that the returned vector should contain
string slices that reference slices of the argument <code>contents</code> (rather than the
argument <code>query</code>).</p>
<p>In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the <code>search</code> function
will live as long as the data passed into the <code>search</code> function in the
<code>contents</code> argument. This is important! The data referenced <em>by</em> a slice needs
to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we’re making
string slices of <code>query</code> rather than <code>contents</code>, it will do its safety checking
incorrectly.</p>
<p>If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we’ll
get this error:</p>

<p>Rust can’t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell
it explicitly. Because <code>contents</code> is the argument that contains all of our text
and we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know <code>contents</code> is
the argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime
syntax.</p>
<p>Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return
values in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time. You might
want to compare this example with the <a href="ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#validating-references-with-lifetimes">“Validating References with
Lifetimes”</a><!-- ignore --> section in

<p>Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix
that and implement <code>search</code>, our program needs to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterate through each line of the contents.</li>
<li>Check whether the line contains our query string.</li>
<li>If it does, add it to the list of values we’re returning.</li>
<li>If it doesn’t, do nothing.</li>
<li>Return the list of results that match.</li>

<p>We’re still using a <code>for</code> loop to return each line from <code>search</code> and print it.</p>
<p>Now the entire program should work! Let’s try it out, first with a word that
should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, “frog”:</p>

     Running `target/debug/minigrep frog poem.txt`
How public, like a frog
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now let’s try a word that will match multiple lines, like “body”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- body poem.txt

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, let’s make sure that we don’t get any lines when we search for a
word that isn’t anywhere in the poem, such as “monomorphization”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- monomorphization poem.txt

<p>Excellent! We’ve built our own mini version of a classic tool and learned a lot
about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file input
and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.</p>
<p>To round out this project, we’ll briefly demonstrate how to work with
environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which are
useful when you’re writing command line programs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="working-with-environment-variables"><a class="header" href="#working-with-environment-variables">Working with Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>We’ll improve <code>minigrep</code> by adding an extra feature: an option for
case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment
variable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that
users enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead making it an
environment variable, we allow our users to set the environment variable once
and have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.</p>
<h3 id="writing-a-failing-test-for-the-case-insensitive-search-function"><a class="header" href="#writing-a-failing-test-for-the-case-insensitive-search-function">Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive <code>search</code> Function</a></h3>
<p>We first add a new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function that will be called when
the environment variable has a value. We’ll continue to follow the TDD process,
so the first step is again to write a failing test. We’ll add a new test for
the new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function and rename our old test from
<code>one_result</code> to <code>case_sensitive</code> to clarify the differences between the two
tests, as shown in Listing 12-20.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the
case-insensitive function we’re about to add</span></p>
<p>Note that we’ve edited the old test’s <code>contents</code> too. We’ve added a new line
with the text <code>&quot;Duct tape.&quot;</code> using a capital D that shouldn’t match the query
<code>&quot;duct&quot;</code> when we’re searching in a case-sensitive manner. Changing the old test
in this way helps ensure that we don’t accidentally break the case-sensitive
search functionality that we’ve already implemented. This test should pass now
and should continue to pass as we work on the case-insensitive search.</p>
<p>The new test for the case-<em>insensitive</em> search uses <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code> as its query. In
the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function we’re about to add, the query <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>
should match the line containing <code>&quot;Rust:&quot;</code> with a capital R and match the line
<code>&quot;Trust me.&quot;</code> even though both have different casing from the query. This is
our failing test, and it will fail to compile because we haven’t yet defined
the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function. Feel free to add a skeleton
implementation that always returns an empty vector, similar to the way we did
for the <code>search</code> function in Listing 12-16 to see the test compile and fail.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-the-search_case_insensitive-function"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-search_case_insensitive-function">Implementing the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> Function</a></h3>
<p>The <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the <code>search</code> function. The only difference is that we’ll lowercase
the <code>query</code> and each <code>line</code> so whatever the case of the input arguments,
they’ll be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-21: Defining the <code>search_case_insensitive</code>
function to lowercase the query and the line before comparing them</span></p>
<p>First, we lowercase the <code>query</code> string and store it in a shadowed variable with
the same name. Calling <code>to_lowercase</code> on the query is necessary so no
matter whether the user’s query is <code>&quot;rust&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;RUST&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Rust&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>,
we’ll treat the query as if it were <code>&quot;rust&quot;</code> and be insensitive to the case.
While <code>to_lowercase</code> will handle basic Unicode, it won’t be 100% accurate. If
we were writing a real application, we’d want to do a bit more work here, but
this section is about environment variables, not Unicode, so we’ll leave it at
that here.</p>
<p>Note that <code>query</code> is now a <code>String</code> rather than a string slice, because calling
<code>to_lowercase</code> creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the
query is <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>, as an example: that string slice doesn’t contain a lowercase
<code>u</code> or <code>t</code> for us to use, so we have to allocate a new <code>String</code> containing
<code>&quot;rust&quot;</code>. When we pass <code>query</code> as an argument to the <code>contains</code> method now, we
need to add an ampersand because the signature of <code>contains</code> is defined to take
a string slice.</p>
<p>Next, we add a call to <code>to_lowercase</code> on each <code>line</code> to lowercase all
characters. Now that we’ve converted <code>line</code> and <code>query</code> to lowercase, we’ll
find matches no matter what the case of the query is.</p>
<p>Let’s see if this implementation passes the tests:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-23: Checking for any value in an environment
variable named <code>IGNORE_CASE</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we create a new variable <code>ignore_case</code>. To set its value, we call the
<code>env::var</code> function and pass it the name of the <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> environment
variable. The <code>env::var</code> function returns a <code>Result</code> that will be the
successful <code>Ok</code> variant that contains the value of the environment variable if
the environment variable is set to any value. It will return the <code>Err</code> variant
if the environment variable is not set.</p>
<p>We’re using the <code>is_ok</code> method on the <code>Result</code> to check whether the environment
variable is set, which means the program should do a case-insensitive search.
If the <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> environment variable isn’t set to anything, <code>is_ok</code> will
return false and the program will perform a case-sensitive search. We don’t
care about the <em>value</em> of the environment variable, just whether it’s set or
unset, so we’re checking <code>is_ok</code> rather than using <code>unwrap</code>, <code>expect</code>, or any
of the other methods we’ve seen on <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>We pass the value in the <code>ignore_case</code> variable to the <code>Config</code> instance so the
<code>run</code> function can read that value and decide whether to call
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> or <code>search</code>, as we implemented in Listing 12-22.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a try! First, we’ll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query <code>to</code>, which should match any line that contains
the word “to” in all lowercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- to poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like that still works! Now, let’s run the program with <code>IGNORE_CASE</code>
set to <code>1</code> but with the same query <code>to</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable and
run the program as separate commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">PS&gt; $Env:IGNORE_CASE=1; cargo run -- to poem.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This will make <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> persist for the remainder of your shell
session. It can be unset with the <code>Remove-Item</code> cmdlet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">PS&gt; Remove-Item Env:IGNORE_CASE
</code></pre>
<p>We should get lines that contain “to” that might have uppercase letters:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-23
IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt
can't extract because of the environment variable
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent, we also got lines containing “To”! Our <code>minigrep</code> program can now do
case-insensitive searching controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables.</p>
<p>Some programs allow arguments <em>and</em> environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case sensitivity
through either a command line argument or an environment variable. Decide
whether the command line argument or the environment variable should take
precedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and one set to
ignore case.</p>
<p>The <code>std::env</code> module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables: check out its documentation to see what is available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output"><a class="header" href="#writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output">Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output</a></h2>
<p>At the moment, we’re writing all of our output to the terminal using the
<code>println!</code> macro. In most terminals, there are two kinds of output: <em>standard
output</em> (<code>stdout</code>) for general information and <em>standard error</em> (<code>stderr</code>) for
error messages. This distinction enables users to choose to direct the
successful output of a program to a file but still print error messages to the
screen.</p>
<p>The <code>println!</code> macro is only capable of printing to standard output, so we
have to use something else to print to standard error.</p>
<h3 id="checking-where-errors-are-written"><a class="header" href="#checking-where-errors-are-written">Checking Where Errors Are Written</a></h3>
<p>First, let’s observe how the content printed by <code>minigrep</code> is currently being
written to standard output, including any error messages we want to write to
standard error instead. We’ll do that by redirecting the standard output stream
to a file while intentionally causing an error. We won’t redirect the standard
error stream, so any content sent to standard error will continue to display on
the screen.</p>
<p>Command line programs are expected to send error messages to the standard error
stream so we can still see error messages on the screen even if we redirect the
standard output stream to a file. Our program is not currently well-behaved:
we’re about to see that it saves the error message output to a file instead!</p>
<p>To demonstrate this behavior, we’ll run the program with <code>&gt;</code> and the file path,
<em>output.txt</em>, that we want to redirect the standard output stream to. We won’t
pass any arguments, which should cause an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard output to
<em>output.txt</em> instead of the screen. We didn’t see the error message we were
expecting printed to the screen, so that means it must have ended up in the
file. This is what <em>output.txt</em> contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, our error message is being printed to standard output. It’s much more
useful for error messages like this to be printed to standard error so only
data from a successful run ends up in the file. We’ll change that.</p>
<h3 id="printing-errors-to-standard-error"><a class="header" href="#printing-errors-to-standard-error">Printing Errors to Standard Error</a></h3>
<p>We’ll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are printed.
Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all the code that
prints error messages is in one function, <code>main</code>. The standard library provides
the <code>eprintln!</code> macro that prints to the standard error stream, so let’s change
the two places we were calling <code>println!</code> to print errors to use <code>eprintln!</code>
instead.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::env;
</span><span class="boring">use std::process;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">use minigrep::Config;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::build(&amp;args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!(&quot;Problem parsing arguments: {err}&quot;);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        eprintln!(&quot;Application error: {e}&quot;);
        process::exit(1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-24: Writing error messages to standard error
instead of standard output using <code>eprintln!</code></span></p>
<p>Let’s now run the program again in the same way, without any arguments and
redirecting standard output with <code>&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Now we see the error onscreen and <em>output.txt</em> contains nothing, which is the
behavior we expect of command line programs.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error but still
redirect standard output to a file, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- to poem.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We won’t see any output to the terminal, and <em>output.txt</em> will contain our
results:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: output.txt</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates that we’re now using standard output for successful output
and standard error for error output as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="summary-12"><a class="header" href="#summary-12">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This chapter recapped some of the major concepts you’ve learned so far and
covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust. By using command line
arguments, files, environment variables, and the <code>eprintln!</code> macro for printing
errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. Combined with
the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well organized, store data
effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors nicely, and be
well tested.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll explore some Rust features that were influenced by functional
languages: closures and iterators.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functional-language-features-iterators-and-closures"><a class="header" href="#functional-language-features-iterators-and-closures">Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures</a></h1>
<p>Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and
techniques, and one significant influence is <em>functional programming</em>.
Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by
passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them
to variables for later execution, and so forth.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we won’t debate the issue of what functional programming is or
isn’t but will instead discuss some features of Rust that are similar to
features in many languages often referred to as functional.</p>
<p>More specifically, we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Closures</em>, a function-like construct you can store in a variable</li>
<li><em>Iterators</em>, a way of processing a series of elements</li>
<li>How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12</li>
<li>The performance of closures and iterators (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than
you might think!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve already covered some other Rust features, such as pattern matching and
enums, that are also influenced by the functional style. Because mastering
closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust
code, we’ll devote this entire chapter to them.</p>

<p>Rust’s closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as
arguments to other functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can create the closure in one place and then
call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re defined.
We’ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior
customization.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-the-environment-with-closures"><a class="header" href="#capturing-the-environment-with-closures">Capturing the Environment with Closures</a></h2>
<p>We’ll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the
environment they’re defined in for later use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the scenario:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Every so
often, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to
someone on our mailing list as a promotion.</li>
<li>People on the mailing list can
optionally add their favorite color to their profile.</li>
<li>If the person chosen for
a free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt.</li>
<li>If the
person hasn’t specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company
currently has the most of.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to implement this. For this example, we’re going to use an
enum called <code>ShirtColor</code> that has the variants <code>Red</code> and <code>Blue</code> (limiting the
number of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company’s
inventory with an <code>Inventory</code> struct that has a field named <code>shirts</code> that
contains a <code>Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> representing the shirt colors currently in stock.
The method <code>giveaway</code> defined on <code>Inventory</code> gets the optional shirt
color preference of the free shirt winner, and returns the shirt color the
person will get.</p>
<p>This setup is shown in Listing 13-1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveaway(&amp;self, user_preference: Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;) -&gt; ShirtColor {
        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }

    fn most_stocked(&amp;self) -&gt; ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;

        for color in &amp;self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red =&gt; num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue =&gt; num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        if num_red &gt; num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],
    };

    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
    let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        &quot;The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}&quot;,
        user_pref1, giveaway1
    );

    let user_pref2 = None;
    let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        &quot;The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}&quot;,
        user_pref2, giveaway2
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-1: Shirt company giveaway situation</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>store</code> defined in <code>main</code> has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining
to distribute for this limited-edition promotion.</li>
<li>We call the <code>giveaway</code> method
for a user with a preference for a red shirt and a user without any preference.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus on
closures, we’ve stuck to concepts you’ve already learned except for the body of
the <code>giveaway</code> method that uses a closure.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>giveaway</code> method, we get the
user preference as a parameter of type <code>Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> and call the

<blockquote>
<p>There are more differences between functions and closures.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Closures don’t
usually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value
like <code>fn</code> functions do.</li>
<li>Type annotations are required on functions because the
types are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users.</li>
<li>Defining this
interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types
of values a function uses and returns.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Closures, on the other hand, aren’t used
in an exposed interface like this: they’re stored in variables and used without
naming them and exposing them to users of our library.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather
than in any arbitrary scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within these limited contexts, the compiler can
infer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it’s able
to infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler
needs closure type annotations too).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase
explicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly
necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Annotating the types for a closure would look like the definition
shown in Listing 13-2. In this example, we’re defining a closure and storing it
in a variable rather than defining the closure in the spot we pass it as an
argument as we did in Listing 13-1.</p>

<p>Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value from
the environment where the closure is defined (thus affecting what, if anything,
is moved <em>into</em> the closure), the code in the body of the closure defines what
happens to the references or values when the closure is evaluated later (thus
affecting what, if anything, is moved <em>out of</em> the closure).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A closure body can
do any of the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>move a captured value out of the closure</li>
<li>mutate the
captured value</li>
<li>neither move nor mutate the value, or capture nothing from the
environment to begin with.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects
which traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs
can specify what kinds of closures they can use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closures will automatically
implement one, two, or all three of these <code>Fn</code> traits, in an additive fashion,
depending on how the closure’s body handles the values:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>FnOnce</code> applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement
at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that
moves captured values out of its body will only implement <code>FnOnce</code> and none
of the other <code>Fn</code> traits, because it can only be called once.</li>
<li><code>FnMut</code> applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their
body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be
called more than once.</li>
<li><code>Fn</code> applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body
and that don’t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture
nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once
without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as
calling a closure multiple times concurrently.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> that
we used in Listing 13-1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else&lt;F&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; T
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) =&gt; x,
            None =&gt; f(),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall that <code>T</code> is the generic type representing the type of the value in the
<code>Some</code> variant of an <code>Option</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That type <code>T</code> is also the return type of the
<code>unwrap_or_else</code> function: code that calls <code>unwrap_or_else</code> on an
<code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code>, for example, will get a <code>String</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, notice that the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> function has the additional generic type
parameter <code>F</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>F</code> type is the type of the parameter named <code>f</code>, which is
the closure we provide when calling <code>unwrap_or_else</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trait bound specified on the generic type <code>F</code> is <code>FnOnce() -&gt; T</code>, which
means <code>F</code> must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and return a <code>T</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <code>FnOnce</code> in the trait bound expresses the constraint that
<code>unwrap_or_else</code> is only going to call <code>f</code> at most one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the body of
<code>unwrap_or_else</code>, we can see that if the <code>Option</code> is <code>Some</code>, <code>f</code> won’t be
called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <code>Option</code> is <code>None</code>, <code>f</code> will be called once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because all
closures implement <code>FnOnce</code>, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> accepts the most different kinds
of closures and is as flexible as it can be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Functions can implement all three of the <code>Fn</code> traits too.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If what we
want to do doesn’t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use
the name of a function rather than a closure where we need something that
implements one of the <code>Fn</code> traits.</li>
<li>For example, on an <code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> value,
we could call <code>unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)</code> to get a new, empty vector if the
value is <code>None</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at the standard library method <code>sort_by_key</code> defined on slices,
to see how that differs from <code>unwrap_or_else</code> and why <code>sort_by_key</code> uses
<code>FnMut</code> instead of <code>FnOnce</code> for the trait bound.</p>
<p>The closure gets one argument
in the form of a reference to the current item in the slice being considered,
and returns a value of type <code>K</code> that can be ordered. This function is useful
when you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item.</p>
<p>In
Listing 13-7, we have a list of <code>Rectangle</code> instances and we use <code>sort_by_key</code>
to order them by their <code>width</code> attribute from low to high:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

<p>The error points to the line in the closure body that moves <code>value</code> out of the
environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fix this, we need to change the closure body so that it doesn’t
move values out of the environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To count the number of times <code>sort_by_key</code>
is called, keeping a counter in the environment and incrementing its value in
the closure body is a more straightforward way to calculate that. The closure
in Listing 13-9 works with <code>sort_by_key</code> because it is only capturing a mutable
reference to the <code>num_sort_operations</code> counter and can therefore be called more
than once:</p>

<p>The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in
turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and
determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don’t
have to reimplement that logic yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Rust, iterators are <em>lazy</em>, meaning they have no effect until you call
methods that consume the iterator to use it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the code in
Listing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector <code>v1</code> by calling
the <code>iter</code> method defined on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>. This code by itself doesn’t do anything
useful.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-10: Creating an iterator</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The iterator is stored in the <code>v1_iter</code> variable.</li>
<li>Once we’ve created an
iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways.</li>
<li>In Listing 3-5 in Chapter 3, we
iterated over an array using a <code>for</code> loop to execute some code on each of its
items.</li>
<li>Under the hood this implicitly created and then consumed an iterator,
but we glossed over how exactly that works until now.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the iterator from
the use of the iterator in the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <code>for</code> loop is called using
the iterator in <code>v1_iter</code>, each element in the iterator is used in one
iteration of the loop, which prints out each value.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

        println!(&quot;Got: {}&quot;, val);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-11: Using an iterator in a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>In languages that don’t have iterators provided by their standard libraries,
you would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index
0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and
incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of
items in the vector.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you
could potentially mess up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same
logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can
index into, like vectors. Let’s examine how iterators do that.</p>

<p>Notice this definition uses some new syntax: <code>type Item</code> and <code>Self::Item</code>,
which are defining an <em>associated type</em> with this trait.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We’ll talk about
associated types in depth in Chapter 19.</li>
<li>For now, all you need to know is that
this code says implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait requires that you also define
an <code>Item</code> type, and this <code>Item</code> type is used in the return type of the <code>next</code>
method.</li>
<li>In other words, the <code>Item</code> type will be the type returned from the
iterator.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait only requires implementors to define one method: the
<code>next</code> method</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped in
<code>Some</code></li>
<li>and, when iteration is over, returns <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>We can call the <code>next</code> method on iterators directly;</li>

is why you’re required to implement the <code>next</code> method when implementing the

</ul>

function from Listing 12-23</span></p>
<p>At the time, we said not to worry about the inefficient <code>clone</code> calls because
we would remove them in the future. Well, that time is now!</p>
<p>We needed <code>clone</code> here because we have a slice with <code>String</code> elements in the
parameter <code>args</code>, but the <code>build</code> function doesn’t own <code>args</code>. To return
ownership of a <code>Config</code> instance, we had to clone the values from the <code>query</code>
and <code>filename</code> fields of <code>Config</code> so the <code>Config</code> instance can own its values.</p>
<p>With our new knowledge about iterators, we can change the <code>build</code> function to
take ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of borrowing a slice.
We’ll use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length
of the slice and indexes into specific locations. This will clarify what the
<code>Config::build</code> function is doing because the iterator will access the values.</p>
<p>Once <code>Config::build</code> takes ownership of the iterator and stops using indexing
operations that borrow, we can move the <code>String</code> values from the iterator into
<code>Config</code> rather than calling <code>clone</code> and making a new allocation.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-19: Updating the signature of <code>Config::build</code>
to expect an iterator</span></p>
<p>The standard library documentation for the <code>env::args</code> function shows that the
type of the iterator it returns is <code>std::env::Args</code>, and that type implements
the <code>Iterator</code> trait and returns <code>String</code> values.</p>
<p>We’ve updated the signature of the <code>Config::build</code> function so the parameter
<code>args</code> has a generic type with the trait bounds <code>impl Iterator&lt;Item = String&gt;</code>
instead of <code>&amp;[String]</code>. This usage of the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax we discussed in
the <a href="ch10-02-traits.html#traits-as-parameters">“Traits as Parameters”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 10
means that <code>args</code> can be any type that implements the <code>Iterator</code> type and
returns <code>String</code> items.</p>
<p>Because we’re taking ownership of <code>args</code> and we’ll be mutating <code>args</code> by
iterating over it, we can add the <code>mut</code> keyword into the specification of the
<code>args</code> parameter to make it mutable.</p>
<h4 id="using-iterator-trait-methods-instead-of-indexing"><a class="header" href="#using-iterator-trait-methods-instead-of-indexing">Using <code>Iterator</code> Trait Methods Instead of Indexing</a></h4>
<p>Next, we’ll fix the body of <code>Config::build</code>. Because <code>args</code> implements the
<code>Iterator</code> trait, we know we can call the <code>next</code> method on it! Listing 13-20
updates the code from Listing 12-23 to use the <code>next</code> method:</p>

<p>Remember that the first value in the return value of <code>env::args</code> is the name of
the program. We want to ignore that and get to the next value, so first we call
<code>next</code> and do nothing with the return value. Second, we call <code>next</code> to get the
value we want to put in the <code>query</code> field of <code>Config</code>. If <code>next</code> returns a
<code>Some</code>, we use a <code>match</code> to extract the value. If it returns <code>None</code>, it means
not enough arguments were given and we return early with an <code>Err</code> value. We do
the same thing for the <code>filename</code> value.</p>

<p>We can write this code in a more concise way using iterator adaptor methods.
Doing so also lets us avoid having a mutable intermediate <code>results</code> vector. The
functional programming style prefers to minimize the amount of mutable state to
make code clearer. Removing the mutable state might enable a future enhancement
to make searching happen in parallel, because we wouldn’t have to manage
concurrent access to the <code>results</code> vector. Listing 13-22 shows this change:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-22: Using iterator adaptor methods in the
implementation of the <code>search</code> function</span></p>
<p>Recall that the purpose of the <code>search</code> function is to return all lines in
<code>contents</code> that contain the <code>query</code>. Similar to the <code>filter</code> example in Listing
13-16, this code uses the <code>filter</code> adaptor to keep only the lines that
<code>line.contains(query)</code> returns <code>true</code> for. We then collect the matching lines
into another vector with <code>collect</code>. Much simpler! Feel free to make the same
change to use iterator methods in the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function as
well.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-between-loops-or-iterators"><a class="header" href="#choosing-between-loops-or-iterators">Choosing Between Loops or Iterators</a></h3>
<p>The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own code and
why: the original implementation in Listing 13-21 or the version using
iterators in Listing 13-22. Most Rust programmers prefer to use the iterator
style. It’s a bit tougher to get the hang of at first, but once you get a feel
for the various iterator adaptors and what they do, iterators can be easier to
understand. Instead of fiddling with the various bits of looping and building
new vectors, the code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop. This
abstracts away some of the commonplace code so it’s easier to see the concepts
that are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each element in
the iterator must pass.</p>
<p>But are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assumption
might be that the more low-level loop will be faster. Let’s talk about
performance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="comparing-performance-loops-vs-iterators"><a class="header" href="#comparing-performance-loops-vs-iterators">Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators</a></h2>
<p>To determine whether to use loops or iterators, you need to know which
implementation is faster: the version of the <code>search</code> function with an explicit
<code>for</code> loop or the version with iterators.</p>
<p>We ran a benchmark by loading the entire contents of <em>The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes</em> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a <code>String</code> and looking for the
word <em>the</em> in the contents. Here are the results of the benchmark on the
version of <code>search</code> using the <code>for</code> loop and the version using iterators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">test bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)
test bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)
</code></pre>
<p>The iterator version was slightly faster! We won’t explain the benchmark code
here, because the point is not to prove that the two versions are equivalent
but to get a general sense of how these two implementations compare
performance-wise.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive benchmark, you should check using various texts of
various sizes as the <code>contents</code>, different words and words of different lengths
as the <code>query</code>, and all kinds of other variations. The point is this:
iterators, although a high-level abstraction, get compiled down to roughly the
same code as if you’d written the lower-level code yourself. Iterators are one
of Rust’s <em>zero-cost abstractions</em>, by which we mean using the abstraction
imposes no additional runtime overhead. This is analogous to how Bjarne
Stroustrup, the original designer and implementor of C++, defines
<em>zero-overhead</em> in “Foundations of C++” (2012):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you
don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand
code any better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As another example, the following code is taken from an audio decoder. The
decoding algorithm uses the linear prediction mathematical operation to
estimate future values based on a linear function of the previous samples. This
code uses an iterator chain to do some math on three variables in scope: a
<code>buffer</code> slice of data, an array of 12 <code>coefficients</code>, and an amount by which
to shift data in <code>qlp_shift</code>. We’ve declared the variables within this example
but not given them any values; although this code doesn’t have much meaning
outside of its context, it’s still a concise, real-world example of how Rust
translates high-level ideas to low-level code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let buffer: &amp;mut [i32];
let coefficients: [i64; 12];
let qlp_shift: i16;

for i in 12..buffer.len() {
    let prediction = coefficients.iter()
                                 .zip(&amp;buffer[i - 12..i])
                                 .map(|(&amp;c, &amp;s)| c * s as i64)
                                 .sum::&lt;i64&gt;() &gt;&gt; qlp_shift;
    let delta = buffer[i];
    buffer[i] = prediction as i32 + delta;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To calculate the value of <code>prediction</code>, this code iterates through each of the
12 values in <code>coefficients</code> and uses the <code>zip</code> method to pair the coefficient
values with the previous 12 values in <code>buffer</code>. Then, for each pair, we
multiply the values together, sum all the results, and shift the bits in the
sum <code>qlp_shift</code> bits to the right.</p>
<p>Calculations in applications like audio decoders often prioritize performance
most highly. Here, we’re creating an iterator, using two adaptors, and then
consuming the value. What assembly code would this Rust code compile to? Well,
as of this writing, it compiles down to the same assembly you’d write by hand.
There’s no loop at all corresponding to the iteration over the values in
<code>coefficients</code>: Rust knows that there are 12 iterations, so it “unrolls” the
loop. <em>Unrolling</em> is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop
controlling code and instead generates repetitive code for each iteration of
the loop.</p>
<p>All of the coefficients get stored in registers, which means accessing the
values is very fast. There are no bounds checks on the array access at runtime.
All these optimizations that Rust is able to apply make the resulting code
extremely efficient. Now that you know this, you can use iterators and closures
without fear! They make code seem like it’s higher level but don’t impose a
runtime performance penalty for doing so.</p>
<h2 id="summary-13"><a class="header" href="#summary-13">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Closures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming
language ideas. They contribute to Rust’s capability to clearly express
high-level ideas at low-level performance. The implementations of closures and
iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of
Rust’s goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let’s look at
some more features of <code>cargo</code> that will help us share the project with the
world.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="more-about-cargo-and-cratesio"><a class="header" href="#more-about-cargo-and-cratesio">More About Cargo and Crates.io</a></h1>
<p>So far we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test
our code, but it can do a lot more. In this chapter, we’ll discuss some of its
other, more advanced features to show you how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your build through release profiles</li>
<li>Publish libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --></li>
<li>Organize large projects with workspaces</li>
<li>Install binaries from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --></li>
<li>Extend Cargo using custom commands</li>
</ul>
<p>Cargo can do even more than the functionality we cover in this chapter, so for
a full explanation of all its features, see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its
documentation</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="customizing-builds-with-release-profiles"><a class="header" href="#customizing-builds-with-release-profiles">Customizing Builds with Release Profiles</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, <em>release profiles</em> are predefined and customizable profiles with
different configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over
various options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently of
the others.</p>
<p>Cargo has two main profiles: the <code>dev</code> profile Cargo uses when you run <code>cargo build</code> and the <code>release</code> profile Cargo uses when you run <code>cargo build --release</code>. The <code>dev</code> profile is defined with good defaults for development,
and the <code>release</code> profile has good defaults for release builds.</p>
<p>These profile names might be familiar from the output of your builds:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
anywhere, run:
cargo build
cargo build --release
and ensure output below is accurate
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
$ cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0s
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dev</code> and <code>release</code> are these different profiles used by the compiler.</p>
<p>Cargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when you haven’t
explicitly added any <code>[profile.*]</code> sections in the project’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file.
By adding <code>[profile.*]</code> sections for any profile you want to customize, you
override any subset of the default settings. For example, here are the default
values for the <code>opt-level</code> setting for the <code>dev</code> and <code>release</code> profiles:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>opt-level</code> setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to
your code, with a range of 0 to 3. Applying more optimizations extends
compiling time, so if you’re in development and compiling your code often,
you’ll want fewer optimizations to compile faster even if the resulting code
runs slower. The default <code>opt-level</code> for <code>dev</code> is therefore <code>0</code>. When you’re
ready to release your code, it’s best to spend more time compiling. You’ll only
compile in release mode once, but you’ll run the compiled program many times,
so release mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. That is
why the default <code>opt-level</code> for the <code>release</code> profile is <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>You can override a default setting by adding a different value for it in
<em>Cargo.toml</em>. For example, if we want to use optimization level 1 in the
development profile, we can add these two lines to our project’s <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1
</code></pre>
<p>This code overrides the default setting of <code>0</code>. Now when we run <code>cargo build</code>,
Cargo will use the defaults for the <code>dev</code> profile plus our customization to
<code>opt-level</code>. Because we set <code>opt-level</code> to <code>1</code>, Cargo will apply more
optimizations than the default, but not as many as in a release build.</p>
<p>For the full list of configuration options and defaults for each profile, see
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html">Cargo’s documentation</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="publishing-a-crate-to-cratesio"><a class="header" href="#publishing-a-crate-to-cratesio">Publishing a Crate to Crates.io</a></h2>
<p>We’ve used packages from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> as
dependencies of our project, but you can also share your code with other people
by publishing your own packages. The crate registry at
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> distributes the source code of
your packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.</p>
<p>Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people
to find and use. We’ll talk about some of these features next and then explain
how to publish a package.</p>
<h3 id="making-useful-documentation-comments"><a class="header" href="#making-useful-documentation-comments">Making Useful Documentation Comments</a></h3>
<p>Accurately documenting your packages will help other users know how and when to
use them, so it’s worth investing the time to write documentation. In Chapter
3, we discussed how to comment Rust code using two slashes, <code>//</code>. Rust also has
a particular kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as a
<em>documentation comment</em>, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML
displays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended
for programmers interested in knowing how to <em>use</em> your crate as opposed to how
your crate is <em>implemented</em>.</p>
<p>Documentation comments use three slashes, <code>///</code>, instead of two and support
Markdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments just
before the item they’re documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments
for an <code>add_one</code> function in a crate named <code>my_crate</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-1: A documentation comment for a
function</span></p>
<p>Here, we give a description of what the <code>add_one</code> function does, start a
section with the heading <code>Examples</code>, and then provide code that demonstrates
how to use the <code>add_one</code> function. We can generate the HTML documentation from
this documentation comment by running <code>cargo doc</code>. This command runs the
<code>rustdoc</code> tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation
in the <em>target/doc</em> directory.</p>
<p>For convenience, running <code>cargo doc --open</code> will build the HTML for your
current crate’s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your
crate’s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the
<code>add_one</code> function and you’ll see how the text in the documentation comments is
rendered, as shown in Figure 14-1:</p>
<img alt="Rendered HTML documentation for the `add_one` function of `my_crate`" src="img/trpl14-01.png" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-1: HTML documentation for the <code>add_one</code>
function</span></p>
<h4 id="commonly-used-sections"><a class="header" href="#commonly-used-sections">Commonly Used Sections</a></h4>
<p>We used the <code># Examples</code> Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section
in the HTML with the title “Examples.” Here are some other sections that crate
authors commonly use in their documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panics</strong>: The scenarios in which the function being documented could
panic. Callers of the function who don’t want their programs to panic should
make sure they don’t call the function in these situations.</li>
<li><strong>Errors</strong>: If the function returns a <code>Result</code>, describing the kinds of
errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be
returned can be helpful to callers so they can write code to handle the
different kinds of errors in different ways.</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: If the function is <code>unsafe</code> to call (we discuss unsafety in
Chapter 19), there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe
and covering the invariants that the function expects callers to uphold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most documentation comments don’t need all of these sections, but this is a
good checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will be
interested in knowing about.</p>
<h4 id="documentation-comments-as-tests"><a class="header" href="#documentation-comments-as-tests">Documentation Comments as Tests</a></h4>
<p>Adding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate
how to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus: running <code>cargo test</code> will run the code examples in your documentation as tests! Nothing is
better than documentation with examples. But nothing is worse than examples
that don’t work because the code has changed since the documentation was
written. If we run <code>cargo test</code> with the documentation for the <code>add_one</code>
function from Listing 14-1, we will see a section in the test results like this:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-01/
cargo test
copy just the doc-tests section below
-->
<pre><code class="language-text">   Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we change either the function or the example so the <code>assert_eq!</code> in the
example panics and run <code>cargo test</code> again, we’ll see that the doc tests catch
that the example and the code are out of sync with each other!</p>
<h4 id="commenting-contained-items"><a class="header" href="#commenting-contained-items">Commenting Contained Items</a></h4>
<p>The style of doc comment <code>//!</code> adds documentation to the item that contains the
comments rather than to the items following the comments. We typically use
these doc comments inside the crate root file (<em>src/lib.rs</em> by convention) or
inside a module to document the crate or the module as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the <code>my_crate</code>
crate that contains the <code>add_one</code> function, we add documentation comments that
start with <code>//!</code> to the beginning of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, as shown in Listing
14-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

</span><span class="boring">/// ```
</span><span class="boring">/// let arg = 5;

</span><span class="boring">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
</span><span class="boring">    x + 1
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-2: Documentation for the <code>my_crate</code> crate as a
whole</span></p>
<p>Notice there isn’t any code after the last line that begins with <code>//!</code>. Because
we started the comments with <code>//!</code> instead of <code>///</code>, we’re documenting the item
that contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In
this case, that item is the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, which is the crate root. These
comments describe the entire crate.</p>
<p>When we run <code>cargo doc --open</code>, these comments will display on the front
page of the documentation for <code>my_crate</code> above the list of public items in the
crate, as shown in Figure 14-2:</p>
<img alt="Rendered HTML documentation with a comment for the crate as a whole" src="img/trpl14-02.png" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-2: Rendered documentation for <code>my_crate</code>,
including the comment describing the crate as a whole</span></p>
<p>Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and
modules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to
help your users understand the crate’s organization.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use"><a class="header" href="#exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use">Exporting a Convenient Public API with <code>pub use</code></a></h3>
<p>The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a
crate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you
are and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate
has a large module hierarchy.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the <code>pub</code> keyword, and
bring items into a scope with the <code>use</code> keyword. However, the structure that
makes sense to you while you’re developing a crate might not be very convenient
for your users. You might want to organize your structs in a hierarchy
containing multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type you’ve
defined deep in the hierarchy might have trouble finding out that type exists.
They might also be annoyed at having to enter <code>use</code>
<code>my_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;</code> rather than <code>use</code>
<code>my_crate::UsefulType;</code>.</p>
<p>The good news is that if the structure <em>isn’t</em> convenient for others to use
from another library, you don’t have to rearrange your internal organization:
instead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that’s different
from your private structure by using <code>pub use</code>. Re-exporting takes a public
item in one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were
defined in the other location instead.</p>
<p>For example, say we made a library named <code>art</code> for modeling artistic concepts.
Within this library are two modules: a <code>kinds</code> module containing two enums
named <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> and a <code>utils</code> module containing a
function named <code>mix</code>, as shown in Listing 14-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">//! # Art
//!

pub mod kinds {
    /// The primary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum PrimaryColor {
        Red,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
    }

    /// The secondary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum SecondaryColor {
        Orange,
        Green,
        Purple,
    }
}

pub mod utils {
    use crate::kinds::*;

    /// Combines two primary colors in equal amounts to create
    /// a secondary color.
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -&gt; SecondaryColor {

generated by <code>cargo doc</code> would look like:</p>
<img alt="Rendered documentation for the `art` crate that lists the `kinds` and `utils` modules" src="img/trpl14-03.png" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-3: Front page of the documentation for <code>art</code>

<p>Note that the <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> types aren’t listed on the
front page, nor is the <code>mix</code> function. We have to click <code>kinds</code> and <code>utils</code> to
see them.</p>
<p>Another crate that depends on this library would need <code>use</code> statements that
bring the items from <code>art</code> into scope, specifying the module structure that’s
currently defined. Listing 14-4 shows an example of a crate that uses the
<code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>mix</code> items from the <code>art</code> crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;
use art::utils::mix;

fn main() {
    let red = PrimaryColor::Red;
    let yellow = PrimaryColor::Yellow;
    mix(red, yellow);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-4: A crate using the <code>art</code> crate’s items with
its internal structure exported</span></p>
<p>The author of the code in Listing 14-4, which uses the <code>art</code> crate, had to
figure out that <code>PrimaryColor</code> is in the <code>kinds</code> module and <code>mix</code> is in the
<code>utils</code> module. The module structure of the <code>art</code> crate is more relevant to
developers working on the <code>art</code> crate than to those using it. The internal
structure doesn’t contain any useful information for someone trying to
understand how to use the <code>art</code> crate, but rather causes confusion because
developers who use it have to figure out where to look, and must specify the
module names in the <code>use</code> statements.</p>
<p>To remove the internal organization from the public API, we can modify the
<code>art</code> crate code in Listing 14-3 to add <code>pub use</code> statements to re-export the
items at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-5:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">//! # Art

</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-5: Adding <code>pub use</code> statements to re-export
items</span></p>
<p>The API documentation that <code>cargo doc</code> generates for this crate will now list
and link re-exports on the front page, as shown in Figure 14-4, making the
<code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> types and the <code>mix</code> function easier to find.</p>
<img alt="Rendered documentation for the `art` crate with the re-exports on the front page" src="img/trpl14-04.png" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-4: The front page of the documentation for <code>art</code>
that lists the re-exports</span></p>
<p>The <code>art</code> crate users can still see and use the internal structure from Listing
14-3 as demonstrated in Listing 14-4, or they can use the more convenient
structure in Listing 14-5, as shown in Listing 14-6:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use art::mix;
use art::PrimaryColor;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    let red = PrimaryColor::Red;
</span><span class="boring">    let yellow = PrimaryColor::Yellow;
</span><span class="boring">    mix(red, yellow);
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-6: A program using the re-exported items from
the <code>art</code> crate</span></p>
<p>In cases where there are many nested modules, re-exporting the types at the top
level with <code>pub use</code> can make a significant difference in the experience of
people who use the crate. Another common use of <code>pub use</code> is to re-export
definitions of a dependency in the current crate to make that crate’s
definitions part of your crate’s public API.</p>
<p>Creating a useful public API structure is more of an art than a science, and
you can iterate to find the API that works best for your users. Choosing <code>pub use</code> gives you flexibility in how you structure your crate internally and
decouples that internal structure from what you present to your users. Look at
some of the code of crates you’ve installed to see if their internal structure
differs from their public API.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-cratesio-account"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-cratesio-account">Setting Up a Crates.io Account</a></h3>
<p>Before you can publish any crates, you need to create an account on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> and get an API token. To do so,
visit the home page at <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> and log
in via a GitHub account. (The GitHub account is currently a requirement, but
the site might support other ways of creating an account in the future.) Once
you’re logged in, visit your account settings at
<a href="https://crates.io/me/">https://crates.io/me/</a><!-- ignore --> and retrieve your
API key. Then run the <code>cargo login</code> command with your API key, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
</code></pre>
<p>This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in
<em>~/.cargo/credentials</em>. Note that this token is a <em>secret</em>: do not share it
with anyone else. If you do share it with anyone for any reason, you should
revoke it and generate a new token on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore
-->.</p>
<h3 id="adding-metadata-to-a-new-crate"><a class="header" href="#adding-metadata-to-a-new-crate">Adding Metadata to a New Crate</a></h3>
<p>Let’s say you have a crate you want to publish. Before publishing, you’ll need
to add some metadata in the <code>[package]</code> section of the crate’s <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file.</p>
<p>Your crate will need a unique name. While you’re working on a crate locally,
you can name a crate whatever you’d like. However, crate names on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> are allocated on a first-come,
first-served basis. Once a crate name is taken, no one else can publish a crate
with that name. Before attempting to publish a crate, search for the name you
want to use. If the name has been used, you will need to find another name and
edit the <code>name</code> field in the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file under the <code>[package]</code> section to
use the new name for publishing, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you’ve chosen a unique name, when you run <code>cargo publish</code> to publish
the crate at this point, you’ll get a warning and then an error:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

Caused by:
  the remote server responded with an error: missing or empty metadata fields: description, license. Please see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html for how to upload metadata
</code></pre>
<p>This errors because you’re missing some crucial information: a description and
license are required so people will know what your crate does and under what
terms they can use it. In <em>Cargo.toml</em>, add a description that’s just a
sentence or two, because it will appear with your crate in search results. For
the <code>license</code> field, you need to give a <em>license identifier value</em>. The <a href="http://spdx.org/licenses/">Linux
Foundation’s Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)</a> lists the identifiers
you can use for this value. For example, to specify that you’ve licensed your
crate using the MIT License, add the <code>MIT</code> identifier:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
license = &quot;MIT&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use a license that doesn’t appear in the SPDX, you need to place
the text of that license in a file, include the file in your project, and then
use <code>license-file</code> to specify the name of that file instead of using the
<code>license</code> key.</p>
<p>Guidance on which license is appropriate for your project is beyond the scope
of this book. Many people in the Rust community license their projects in the
same way as Rust by using a dual license of <code>MIT OR Apache-2.0</code>. This practice
demonstrates that you can also specify multiple license identifiers separated
by <code>OR</code> to have multiple licenses for your project.</p>
<p>With a unique name, the version, your description, and a license added, the
<em>Cargo.toml</em> file for a project that is ready to publish might look like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;
description = &quot;A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen.&quot;
license = &quot;MIT OR Apache-2.0&quot;

<h3 id="publishing-to-cratesio"><a class="header" href="#publishing-to-cratesio">Publishing to Crates.io</a></h3>
<p>Now that you’ve created an account, saved your API token, chosen a name for
your crate, and specified the required metadata, you’re ready to publish!
Publishing a crate uploads a specific version to
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> for others to use.</p>
<p>Be careful, because a publish is <em>permanent</em>. The version can never be
overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. One major goal of
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> is to act as a permanent archive
of code so that builds of all projects that depend on crates from
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> will continue to work. Allowing
version deletions would make fulfilling that goal impossible. However, there is
no limit to the number of crate versions you can publish.</p>
<p>Run the <code>cargo publish</code> command again. It should succeed now:</p>

<h3 id="deprecating-versions-from-cratesio-with-cargo-yank"><a class="header" href="#deprecating-versions-from-cratesio-with-cargo-yank">Deprecating Versions from Crates.io with <code>cargo yank</code></a></h3>
<p>Although you can’t remove previous versions of a crate, you can prevent any
future projects from adding them as a new dependency. This is useful when a
crate version is broken for one reason or another. In such situations, Cargo
supports <em>yanking</em> a crate version.</p>
<p>Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while
allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue. Essentially, a
yank means that all projects with a <em>Cargo.lock</em> will not break, and any future
<em>Cargo.lock</em> files generated will not use the yanked version.</p>
<p>To yank a version of a crate, in the directory of the crate that you’ve
previously published, run <code>cargo yank</code> and specify which version you want to
yank. For example, if we’ve published a crate named <code>guessing_game</code> version
1.0.1 and we want to yank it, in the project directory for <code>guessing_game</code> we’d
run:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration:
cargo yank carol-test --version 2.1.0
cargo yank carol-test --version 2.1.0 --undo
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1

        Yank guessing_game@1.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>By adding <code>--undo</code> to the command, you can also undo a yank and allow projects
to start depending on a version again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
    Updating crates.io index
      Unyank guessing_game@1.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>A yank <em>does not</em> delete any code. It cannot, for example, delete accidentally
uploaded secrets. If that happens, you must reset those secrets immediately.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="cargo-workspaces"><a class="header" href="#cargo-workspaces">Cargo Workspaces</a></h2>
<p>In Chapter 12, we built a package that included a binary crate and a library
crate. As your project develops, you might find that the library crate
continues to get bigger and you want to split your package further into
multiple library crates. Cargo offers a feature called <em>workspaces</em> that can
help manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-workspace"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-workspace">Creating a Workspace</a></h3>
<p>A <em>workspace</em> is a set of packages that share the same <em>Cargo.lock</em> and output
directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so we
can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to
structure a workspace, so we’ll just show one common way. We’ll have a
workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide
the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will
provide an <code>add_one</code> function, and a second library an <code>add_two</code> function.
These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating
a new directory for the workspace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ mkdir add
$ cd add
</code></pre>
<p>Next, in the <em>add</em> directory, we create the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that will
configure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a <code>[package]</code> section.
Instead, it will start with a <code>[workspace]</code> section that will allow us to add
members to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary
crate; in this case, that path is <em>adder</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]

members = [
    &quot;adder&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll create the <code>adder</code> binary crate by running <code>cargo new</code> within the
<em>add</em> directory:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-01-adder-crate/add
rm -rf adder
cargo new adder
copy output below
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we can build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code>. The files
in your <em>add</em> directory should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
</code></pre>
<p>The workspace has one <em>target</em> directory at the top level that the compiled
artifacts will be placed into; the <code>adder</code> package doesn’t have its own
<em>target</em> directory. Even if we were to run <code>cargo build</code> from inside the
<em>adder</em> directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in <em>add/target</em>
rather than <em>add/adder/target</em>. Cargo structures the <em>target</em> directory in a
workspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on
each other. If each crate had its own <em>target</em> directory, each crate would have
to recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts
in its own <em>target</em> directory. By sharing one <em>target</em> directory, the crates
can avoid unnecessary rebuilding.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace"><a class="header" href="#creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace">Creating the Second Package in the Workspace</a></h3>
<p>Next, let’s create another member package in the workspace and call it
<code>add_one</code>. Change the top-level <em>Cargo.toml</em> to specify the <em>add_one</em> path in
the <code>members</code> list:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]

members = [
    &quot;adder&quot;,
    &quot;add_one&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Then generate a new library crate named <code>add_one</code>:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-02-add-one/add
rm -rf add_one
cargo new add_one --lib
copy output below
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new add_one --lib
     Created library `add_one` package
</code></pre>
<p>Your <em>add</em> directory should now have these directories and files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add_one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
</code></pre>
<p>In the <em>add_one/src/lib.rs</em> file, let’s add an <code>add_one</code> function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can have the <code>adder</code> package with our binary depend on the <code>add_one</code>
package that has our library. First, we’ll need to add a path dependency on
<code>add_one</code> to <em>adder/Cargo.toml</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: adder/Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
add_one = { path = &quot;../add_one&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo doesn’t assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each other, so
we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships.</p>
<p>Next, let’s use the <code>add_one</code> function (from the <code>add_one</code> crate) in the
<code>adder</code> crate. Open the <em>adder/src/main.rs</em> file and add a <code>use</code> line at the
top to bring the new <code>add_one</code> library crate into scope. Then change the <code>main</code>
function to call the <code>add_one</code> function, as in Listing 14-7.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: adder/src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!(&quot;Hello, world! {num} plus one is {}!&quot;, add_one::add_one(num));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-7: Using the <code>add_one</code> library crate from the

<p>Let’s build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the top-level <em>add</em>

<h4 id="depending-on-an-external-package-in-a-workspace"><a class="header" href="#depending-on-an-external-package-in-a-workspace">Depending on an External Package in a Workspace</a></h4>
<p>Notice that the workspace has only one <em>Cargo.lock</em> file at the top level,
rather than having a <em>Cargo.lock</em> in each crate’s directory. This ensures that
all crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the <code>rand</code>
package to the <em>adder/Cargo.toml</em> and <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> files, Cargo will
resolve both of those to one version of <code>rand</code> and record that in the one
<em>Cargo.lock</em>. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies
means the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let’s add the
<code>rand</code> crate to the <code>[dependencies]</code> section in the <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> file
so we can use the <code>rand</code> crate in the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of

<p>We can now add <code>use rand;</code> to the <em>add_one/src/lib.rs</em> file, and building the
whole workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the <em>add</em> directory will bring in
and compile the <code>rand</code> crate. We will get one warning because we aren’t
referring to the <code>rand</code> we brought into scope:</p>

<p>The top-level <em>Cargo.lock</em> now contains information about the dependency of
<code>add_one</code> on <code>rand</code>. However, even though <code>rand</code> is used somewhere in the
workspace, we can’t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add
<code>rand</code> to their <em>Cargo.toml</em> files as well. For example, if we add <code>use rand;</code>
to the <em>adder/src/main.rs</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package, we’ll get an error:</p>

<p>To fix this, edit the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package and indicate

add <code>rand</code> to the list of dependencies for <code>adder</code> in <em>Cargo.lock</em>, but no
additional copies of <code>rand</code> will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every
crate in every package in the workspace using the <code>rand</code> package will be using

<h4 id="adding-a-test-to-a-workspace"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-test-to-a-workspace">Adding a Test to a Workspace</a></h4>
<p>For another enhancement, let’s add a test of the <code>add_one::add_one</code> function
within the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now run <code>cargo test</code> in the top-level <em>add</em> directory. Running <code>cargo test</code> in
a workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all the crates in
the workspace:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

crate passed. The next section shows that zero tests were found in the <code>adder</code>
crate, and then the last section shows zero documentation tests were found in
the <code>add_one</code> crate.</p>
<p>We can also run tests for one particular crate in a workspace from the
top-level directory by using the <code>-p</code> flag and specifying the name of the crate
we want to test:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

</code></pre>
<p>This output shows <code>cargo test</code> only ran the tests for the <code>add_one</code> crate and
didn’t run the <code>adder</code> crate tests.</p>
<p>If you publish the crates in the workspace to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>,
each crate in the workspace will need to be published separately. Like <code>cargo test</code>, we can publish a particular crate in our workspace by using the <code>-p</code>
flag and specifying the name of the crate we want to publish.</p>
<p>For additional practice, add an <code>add_two</code> crate to this workspace in a similar
way as the <code>add_one</code> crate!</p>
<p>As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it’s easier to understand
smaller, individual components than one big blob of code. Furthermore, keeping
the crates in a workspace can make coordination between crates easier if they
are often changed at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="installing-binaries-with-cargo-install"><a class="header" href="#installing-binaries-with-cargo-install">Installing Binaries with <code>cargo install</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>cargo install</code> command allows you to install and use binary crates
locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a
convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore -->. Note that you can only install
packages that have binary targets. A <em>binary target</em> is the runnable program
that is created if the crate has a <em>src/main.rs</em> file or another file specified
as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t runnable on its own but
is suitable for including within other programs. Usually, crates have
information in the <em>README</em> file about whether a crate is a library, has a
binary target, or both.</p>
<p>All binaries installed with <code>cargo install</code> are stored in the installation
root’s <em>bin</em> folder. If you installed Rust using <em>rustup.rs</em> and don’t have any
custom configurations, this directory will be <em>$HOME/.cargo/bin</em>. Ensure that
directory is in your <code>$PATH</code> to be able to run programs you’ve installed with
<code>cargo install</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there’s a Rust implementation of
the <code>grep</code> tool called <code>ripgrep</code> for searching files. To install <code>ripgrep</code>, we
can run the following:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cargo install something you don't have, copy relevant output below

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo install ripgrep

</code></pre>
<p>The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of the
installed binary, which in the case of <code>ripgrep</code> is <code>rg</code>. As long as the
installation directory is in your <code>$PATH</code>, as mentioned previously, you can
then run <code>rg --help</code> and start using a faster, rustier tool for searching files!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="extending-cargo-with-custom-commands"><a class="header" href="#extending-cargo-with-custom-commands">Extending Cargo with Custom Commands</a></h2>
<p>Cargo is designed so you can extend it with new subcommands without having to
modify Cargo. If a binary in your <code>$PATH</code> is named <code>cargo-something</code>, you can
run it as if it was a Cargo subcommand by running <code>cargo something</code>. Custom
commands like this are also listed when you run <code>cargo --list</code>. Being able to
use <code>cargo install</code> to install extensions and then run them just like the
built-in Cargo tools is a super convenient benefit of Cargo’s design!</p>
<h2 id="summary-14"><a class="header" href="#summary-14">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Sharing code with Cargo and <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> is
part of what makes the Rust ecosystem useful for many different tasks. Rust’s
standard library is small and stable, but crates are easy to share, use, and
improve on a timeline different from that of the language. Don’t be shy about

<blockquote>
<p>A <em>pointer</em> is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference, which you learned about in
Chapter 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>References are indicated by the <code>&amp;</code> symbol and borrow the value they
point to.</li>
<li>They don’t have any special capabilities other than referring to data, and have no overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-pointers-2"><a class="header" href="#smart-pointers-2">Smart Pointers</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Smart pointers</em>, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The concept of
smart pointers isn’t unique to Rust: smart pointers originated in C++ and exist
in other languages as well.</li>
<li>Rust has a variety of smart pointers defined in the
standard library that provide functionality beyond that provided by references.</li>
<li>To explore the general concept, we’ll look at a couple of different examples of
smart pointers, including a <em>reference counting</em> smart pointer type.</li>
<li>reference couting smart pointer enables you to allow data to have multiple owners by keeping track of
the number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, has an additional difference
between references and smart pointers:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while references only borrow data, in
many cases, smart pointers <em>own</em> the data they point to.</p>
<h2 id="string-and-vec"><a class="header" href="#string-and-vec">String and Vec<T>:</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we didn’t call them as such at the time, we’ve already encountered a few
smart pointers in this book, including <code>String</code> and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in Chapter 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Both
these types count as smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you
to manipulate it.</li>
<li>They also have metadata and extra capabilities or guarantees.
<code>String</code>, for example, stores its capacity as metadata and has the extra
ability to ensure its data will always be valid UTF-8.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-pointers-are-usually-implemented-using-structs"><a class="header" href="#smart-pointers-are-usually-implemented-using-structs">Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs.</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the <code>Deref</code> and <code>Drop</code> traits.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Deref</code> trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference
so you can write your code to work with either references or smart pointers.</li>
<li>The <code>Drop</code> trait allows you to customize the code that’s run when an instance
of the smart pointer goes out of scope.</li>
<li>In this chapter, we’ll discuss both
traits and demonstrate why they’re important to smart pointers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-pointer-pattern-is-a-general-design-pattern"><a class="header" href="#smart-pointer-pattern-is-a-general-design-pattern">smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern</a></h2>
<p>Given that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used
frequently in Rust, this chapter won’t cover every existing smart pointer. Many
libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> for allocating values on the heap</li>
<li><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership</li>
<li><code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code>, accessed through <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, a type that enforces
the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interior-mutability"><a class="header" href="#interior-mutability">interior mutability</a></h3>
<p>In addition, we’ll cover the <em>interior mutability</em> pattern where an immutable
type exposes an API for mutating an interior value.</p>
<h3 id="reference-cycles"><a class="header" href="#reference-cycles">reference cycles</a></h3>
<p>We’ll also discuss <em>reference cycles</em>: how they can leak memory and how to prevent them.</p>

<li>The <code>type Target = T;</code> syntax defines an associated type for the <code>Deref</code>
trait to use.</li>
<li>Associated types are a slightly different way of declaring a
generic parameter, but you don’t need to worry about them for now; we’ll cover
them in more detail in Chapter 19.</li>
<li>We fill in the body of the <code>deref</code> method with <code>&amp;self.0</code> so <code>deref</code> returns a
reference to the value we want to access with the <code>*</code> operator;</li>
<li>recall from the
<a href="ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">“Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different
Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5 that <code>.0</code> accesses
the first value in a tuple struct.</li>
<li>The <code>main</code> function in Listing 15-9 that
calls <code>*</code> on the <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> value now compiles, and the assertions pass!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Without the <code>Deref</code> trait, the compiler can only dereference <code>&amp;</code> references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>deref</code> method gives the compiler the ability to take a value of any type
that implements <code>Deref</code> and call the <code>deref</code> method to get a <code>&amp;</code> reference that
it knows how to dereference.</p>
<p>When we entered <code>*y</code> in Listing 15-9, behind the scenes Rust actually ran this
code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">*(y.deref())
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust substitutes the <code>*</code> operator with a call to the <code>deref</code> method and then a
plain dereference so we don’t have to think about whether or not we need to
call the <code>deref</code> method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Rust feature lets us write code that functions
identically whether we have a regular reference or a type that implements
<code>Deref</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason the <code>deref</code> method returns a reference to a value, and that the
plain dereference outside the parentheses in <code>*(y.deref())</code> is still necessary,
is to do with the ownership system:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>deref</code> method returned the value
directly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of
<code>self</code>.</li>
<li>We don’t want to take ownership of the inner value inside <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> in
this case or in most cases where we use the dereference operator.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the <code>*</code> operator is replaced with a call to the <code>deref</code> method and
then a call to the <code>*</code> operator just once, each time we use a <code>*</code> in our code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the substitution of the <code>*</code> operator does not recurse infinitely, we
end up with data of type <code>i32</code>, which matches the <code>5</code> in <code>assert_eq!</code> in
Listing 15-9.</p>

<p><em>Deref coercion</em> converts a reference to a type that implements the <code>Deref</code>
trait into a reference to another type.</p>
<p>For example, deref coercion can convert
<code>&amp;String</code> to <code>&amp;str</code> because <code>String</code> implements the <code>Deref</code> trait such that it
returns <code>&amp;str</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deref coercion is a convenience Rust performs on arguments to
functions and methods, and works only on types that implement the <code>Deref</code>
trait.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type’s
value as an argument to a function or method that doesn’t match the parameter
type in the function or method definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sequence of calls to the <code>deref</code>
method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and
method calls don’t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences
with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deref coercion feature also lets us write more code that
can work for either references or smart pointers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To see deref coercion in action, let’s use the <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> type we defined in
Listing 15-8 as well as the implementation of <code>Deref</code> that we added in Listing
15-10.</p>

<p>Similar to how you use the <code>Deref</code> trait to override the <code>*</code> operator on
immutable references, you can use the <code>DerefMut</code> trait to override the <code>*</code>
operator on mutable references.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>&amp;U</code> when <code>T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;</code></li>
<li>From <code>&amp;mut T</code> to <code>&amp;mut U</code> when <code>T: DerefMut&lt;Target=U&gt;</code></li>
<li>From <code>&amp;mut T</code> to <code>&amp;U</code> when <code>T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The first two cases are the same as each other except that the second
implements mutability:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The first case states that if you have a <code>&amp;T</code>, and <code>T</code>
implements <code>Deref</code> to some type <code>U</code>, you can get a <code>&amp;U</code> transparently.</li>
<li>The second case states that the same deref coercion happens for mutable references.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The third case is trickier:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rust will also coerce a mutable reference to an immutable one.</li>
<li>But the reverse is <em>not</em> possible: immutable references will never coerce to mutable references.</li>
<li>Because of the borrowing rules, if you have a mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only reference to
that data (otherwise, the program wouldn’t compile).</li>
<li>Converting one mutable reference to one immutable reference will never break the borrowing rules.</li>
<li>Converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that the initial immutable reference is the
only immutable reference to that data, but the borrowing rules don’t guarantee that.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Rust can’t make the
assumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference is
possible.</p>

you customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can provide an implementation for the <code>Drop</code> trait on any type, and that code can
be used to release resources like files or network connections.</p>

<p>We’re introducing <code>Drop</code> in the context of smart pointers because the

<p>The most straightforward smart pointer is a <em>box</em>, whose type is written
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack.</li>
<li>What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data.</li>
<li>Refer to Chapter 4 to review the difference between the stack and the heap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boxes don’t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the
heap instead of on the stack. But they don’t have many extra capabilities
either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll use them most often in these situations:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want
to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size</li>
<li>When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but
ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so</li>
<li>When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that
implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>We’ll demonstrate the first situation in the <a href="ch15-01-box.html#enabling-recursive-types-with-boxes">“Enabling Recursive Types with
Boxes”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</li>
<li>In the second case, transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long
time because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in
this situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box.
Then, only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack,
while the data it references stays in one place on the heap.</li>
<li>The third case is known as a <em>trait object</em>, and Chapter 17 devotes an entire section, <a href="ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types">“Using

<p>Before we discuss the heap storage use case for <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, we’ll cover the
syntax and how to interact with values stored within a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Listing 15-1 shows how to use a box to store an <code>i32</code> value on the heap:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!(&quot;b = {}&quot;, b);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-1: Storing an <code>i32</code> value on the heap using a
box</span></p>
<ol>
<li>We define the variable <code>b</code> to have the value of a <code>Box</code> that points to the
value <code>5</code>, which is allocated on the heap.</li>
<li>This program will print <code>b = 5</code>; in
this case, we can access the data in the box similar to how we would if this
data were on the stack.</li>
<li>Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of
scope, as <code>b</code> does at the end of <code>main</code>, it will be deallocated.</li>
<li>The deallocation happens both for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it
points to (stored on the heap).</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting a single value on the heap isn’t very useful, so you won’t use boxes by
themselves in this way very often. Having values like a single <code>i32</code> on the
stack, where they’re stored by default, is more appropriate in the majority of
situations.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a case where boxes allow us to define types that we
wouldn’t be allowed to if we didn’t have boxes.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-recursive-types-with-boxes"><a class="header" href="#enabling-recursive-types-with-boxes">Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A value of <em>recursive type</em> can have another value of the same type as part of
itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recursive types pose an issue because at compile time Rust needs to
know how much space a type takes up. However, the nesting of values of
recursive types could theoretically continue infinitely, so Rust can’t know how
much space the value needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because boxes have a known size, we can enable
recursive types by inserting a box in the recursive type definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example of a recursive type, let’s explore the <em>cons list</em>. This is a data
type commonly found in functional programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cons list type we’ll define is straightforward except for the recursion;</li>
<li>therefore, the
concepts in the example we’ll work with will be useful any time you get into
more complex situations involving recursive types.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-information-about-the-cons-list"><a class="header" href="#more-information-about-the-cons-list">More Information About the Cons List</a></h3>
<p>A <em>cons list</em> is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming language
and its dialects and is made up of nested pairs, and is the Lisp version of a
linked list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its name comes from the <code>cons</code> function (short for “construct
function”) in Lisp that constructs a new pair from its two arguments. By
calling <code>cons</code> on a pair consisting of a value and another pair, we can
construct cons lists made up of recursive pairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, here’s a pseudocode representation of a cons list containing the
list 1, 2, 3 with each pair in parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(1, (2, (3, Nil)))
</code></pre>
<p>Each item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current item and the next item.</p>
<ul>
<li>The last item in the list contains only a value called <code>Nil</code>
without a next item.</li>
<li>A cons list is produced by recursively calling the <code>cons</code>
function.</li>
<li>The canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is <code>Nil</code>.</li>
<li>Note that this is not the same as the “null” or “nil” concept in Chapter 6,
which is an invalid or absent value.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The cons list isn’t a commonly used data structure in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most of the time when you have a list of items in Rust, <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is a better choice to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other, more complex recursive data types <em>are</em> useful in various situations,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>but by starting with the cons list in this chapter, we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive data type without much distraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list. Note that this code
won’t compile yet because the <code>List</code> type doesn’t have a known size, which
we’ll demonstrate.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

<p>Note: We’re implementing a cons list that holds only <code>i32</code> values for the
purposes of this example. We could have implemented it using generics, as we
discussed in Chapter 10, to define a cons list type that could store values of
any type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the <code>List</code> type to store the list <code>1, 2, 3</code> would look like the code in

<li>This <code>List</code> value is another <code>Cons</code> value that holds <code>2</code> and another <code>List</code> value.</li>
<li>This <code>List</code> value is one more <code>Cons</code> value that holds <code>3</code> and a <code>List</code> value, which is finally
<code>Nil</code>, the non-recursive variant that signals the end of the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recall the <code>Message</code> enum we defined in Listing 6-2 when we discussed enum
definitions in Chapter 6:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">enum Message {

</span></code></pre>
<p>To determine how much space to allocate for a <code>Message</code> value, Rust goes
through each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust sees that <code>Message::Quit</code> doesn’t need any space, <code>Message::Move</code> needs enough
space to store two <code>i32</code> values, and so forth.</li>
<li>Because only one variant will be
used, the most space a <code>Message</code> value will need is the space it would take to
store the largest of its variants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrast this with what happens when Rust tries to determine how much space a
recursive type like the <code>List</code> enum in Listing 15-2 needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The compiler starts
by looking at the <code>Cons</code> variant, which holds a value of type <code>i32</code> and a value
of type <code>List</code>.</li>
<li>Therefore, <code>Cons</code> needs an amount of space equal to the size of
an <code>i32</code> plus the size of a <code>List</code>.</li>
<li>To figure out how much memory the <code>List</code>
type needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the <code>Cons</code>
variant.</li>
<li>The <code>Cons</code> variant holds a value of type <code>i32</code> and a value of type
<code>List</code>, and this process continues infinitely, as shown in Figure 15-1.</li>

<p>In this suggestion, “indirection” means that instead of storing a value
directly, we should change the data structure to store the value indirectly by
storing a pointer to the value instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>

value that will be on the heap rather than inside the <code>Cons</code> variant.</li>
<li>Conceptually, we still have a list, created with lists holding other lists, but
this implementation is now more like placing the items next to one another

<p>If we knew which part would finish
last, we could just make that part the data’s owner, and the normal ownership
rules enforced at compile time would take effect.</p>

<li>This time, we’ll create two lists that both share ownership

<li>The <code>borrow</code> method returns the smart pointer type <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li>and <code>borrow_mut</code> returns the smart pointer type <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Both types implement <code>Deref</code>, so we can treat them like regular references.</li>
<li>Every time we call <code>borrow</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active.</li>
<li>When a <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code> value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.</li>

<li>
<p>If you have an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can get a value that can have multiple owners <em>and</em> that you can mutate!</p>

<p><em>Interior mutability</em> is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate
data even when there are immutable references to that data; normally, this
action is disallowed by the borrowing rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To mutate data, the pattern uses
<code>unsafe</code> code inside a data structure to bend Rust’s usual rules that govern
mutation and borrowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsafe code indicates to the compiler that we’re
checking the rules manually instead of relying on the compiler to check them
for us;</p>
<p>we will discuss unsafe code more in Chapter 19.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern only when we can
ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the
compiler can’t guarantee that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>unsafe</code> code involved is then wrapped in a safe API, and the outer type is still immutable.</p>
<p>Let’s explore this concept by looking at the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type that follows the
interior mutability pattern.</p>

this way, it’s conservative.</p>
<p>If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users wouldn’t be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, if Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing catastrophic can occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type is useful when you’re sure your code follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios
and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded
context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll talk about how to get the functionality of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in a
multithreaded program in Chapter 16.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a recap of the reasons to choose <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, or <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Owners:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> enables multiple owners of the same data;
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> have single owners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrows Check:
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time;
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time;
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.</li>
<li>Mutate or not:
Because <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can
mutate the value inside the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> even when the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is
immutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the <em>interior mutability</em>
pattern. Let’s look at a situation in which interior mutability is useful and
examine how it’s possible.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability-a-mutable-borrow-to-an-immutable-value"><a class="header" href="#interior-mutability-a-mutable-borrow-to-an-immutable-value">Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value</a></h2>
<p>A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an immutable value,
you can’t borrow it mutably. For example, this code won’t compile:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust  editable">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &amp;mut x;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you tried to compile this code, you’d get the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling borrowing v0.1.0 (file:///projects/borrowing)
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `x` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate
itself in its methods but appear immutable to other code.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Code outside the value’s methods would not be able to mutate the value.</li>
<li>Using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability, but <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
doesn’t get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the
compiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked
at runtime instead.</li>
<li>If you violate the rules, you’ll get a <code>panic!</code> instead of
a compiler error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s work through a practical example where we can use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to mutate
an immutable value and see why that is useful.</p>
<h3 id="a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects"><a class="header" href="#a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects">A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes during testing a programmer will use a type in place of another type,
in order to observe particular behavior and assert it’s implemented correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This placeholder type is called a <em>test double</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of it in the sense of a
“stunt double” in filmmaking, where a person steps in and substitutes for an
actor to do a particular tricky scene. Test doubles stand in for other types
when we’re running tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mock objects</em> are specific types of test doubles
that record what happens during a test so you can assert that the correct
actions took place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust doesn’t have objects in the same sense as other languages have objects,
and Rust doesn’t have mock object functionality built into the standard library
as some other languages do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, you can definitely create a struct that
will serve the same purposes as a mock object.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the scenario we’ll test:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>we’ll create a library that tracks a value
against a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to the maximum
value the current value is.</li>
<li>This library could be used to keep track of a
user’s quota for the number of API calls they’re allowed to make, for example.</li>
<li>Our library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to the
maximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times.</li>
<li>Applications that use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the
messages: the application could put a message in the application, send an
email, send a text message, or something else. The library doesn’t need to know
that detail.</li>
<li>All it needs is something that implements a trait we’ll provide
called <code>Messenger</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>One important part of this code is that the <code>Messenger</code> trait has one method
called <code>send</code> that takes an immutable reference to <code>self</code> and the text of the
message.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This trait is the interface our mock object needs to implement so that
the mock can be used in the same way a real object is.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The other important part
is that we want to test the behavior of the <code>set_value</code> method on the
<code>LimitTracker</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can change what we pass in for the <code>value</code> parameter, but
<code>set_value</code> doesn’t return anything for us to make assertions on. We want to be
able to say that if we create a <code>LimitTracker</code> with something that implements
the <code>Messenger</code> trait and a particular value for <code>max</code>, when we pass different
numbers for <code>value</code>, the messenger is told to send the appropriate messages.</p>
<p>We need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message when we
call <code>send</code>, will only keep track of the messages it’s told to send. We can
create a new instance of the mock object, create a <code>LimitTracker</code> that uses the
mock object, call the <code>set_value</code> method on <code>LimitTracker</code>, and then check that
the mock object has the messages we expect. Listing 15-21 shows an attempt to
implement a mock object to do just that, but the borrow checker won’t allow it:</p>

<li>In the <code>new</code> function, we create a new <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>
instance around the empty vector.</li>
<li>For the implementation of the <code>send</code> method, the first parameter is still an
immutable borrow of <code>self</code>, which matches the trait definition.</li>
<li>We call
<code>borrow_mut</code> on the <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> in <code>self.sent_messages</code> to get a
mutable reference to the value inside the <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, which is the
vector.</li>
<li>Then we can call <code>push</code> on the mutable reference to the vector to keep
track of the messages sent during the test.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The last change we have to make is in the assertion:
to see how many items are in the inner vector, we call <code>borrow</code> on the <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> to get an
immutable reference to the vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, let’s dig into how it works!</p>

<p>When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code> syntax, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps track of how many <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code> smart pointers are currently active.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we use the <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code> methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>borrow</code> method returns the smart pointer type <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li>and <code>borrow_mut</code> returns the smart pointer type <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Both types implement <code>Deref</code>, so we can treat them like regular references.</li>
<li>Every time we call <code>borrow</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active.</li>
<li>When a <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code> value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.</li>
<li>Just like the compile-time borrowing rules, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> lets us have many immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.</li>

<p>If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as we
would with references, the implementation of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> will panic at
runtime.</p>

<p>Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of <code>send</code> in
Listing 15-22. We’re deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows active
for the same scope to illustrate that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> prevents us from doing this
at runtime.</p>

<p>Notice that the code panicked with the message <code>already borrowed: BorrowMutError</code>. This is how <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> handles violations of the borrowing
rules at runtime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing to catch borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time, as
we’ve done here, means you’d potentially be finding mistakes in your code later
in the development process:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>possibly not until your code was deployed to
production.</li>
<li>Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as
a result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> makes it possible to write a mock object that can
modify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while you’re using it
in a context where only immutable values are allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> despite its trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references provide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A common way to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is in combination with <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall that <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable access to that data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can get a value that can have multiple owners <em>and</em> that you can mutate!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> holds only immutable values, we can’t change any of the values in the list once we’ve created them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s add in <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to gain the ability to change the values in the lists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Listing 15-24 shows that by using a
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>Cons</code> definition, we can modify the value stored in all
the lists:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-24: Using <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> to create a
<code>List</code> that we can mutate</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We create a value that is an instance of <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> and store it in a
variable named <code>value</code> so we can access it directly later.</li>
<li>Then we create a <code>List</code> in <code>a</code> with a <code>Cons</code> variant that holds <code>value</code>.</li>
<li>We need to clone <code>value</code> so both <code>a</code> and <code>value</code> have ownership of the inner <code>5</code> value rather
than transferring ownership from <code>value</code> to <code>a</code> or having <code>a</code> borrow from
<code>value</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We wrap the list <code>a</code> in an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> so when we create lists <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, they
can both refer to <code>a</code>, which is what we did in Listing 15-18.</p>
<p>After we’ve created the lists in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, we want to add 10 to the
value in <code>value</code>. We do this by calling <code>borrow_mut</code> on <code>value</code>, which uses the
automatic dereferencing feature we discussed in Chapter 5 (see the section
<a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#wheres-the---operator">“Where’s the <code>-&gt;</code> Operator?”</a><!-- ignore -->) to
dereference the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to the inner <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> value. The <code>borrow_mut</code>
method returns a <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code> smart pointer, and we use the dereference operator
on it and change the inner value.</p>
<p>When we print <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, we can see that they all have the modified
value of 15 rather than 5:</p>

b after = Cons(RefCell { value: 3 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
c after = Cons(RefCell { value: 4 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This technique is pretty neat!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>By using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we have an outwardly
immutable <code>List</code> value.</li>
<li>But we can use the methods on <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> that provide
access to its interior mutability so we can modify our data when we need to.</li>
<li>The runtime checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and it’s
sometimes worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data
structures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> does not work for multithreaded code!
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is the thread-safe version of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> and we’ll discuss

<p>Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to
accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a <em>memory leak</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust’s guarantees, meaning
memory leaks are memory safe in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We can see that Rust allows memory leaks
by using <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li>it’s possible to create references where items refer to each other in a cycle.</li>
<li>This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.</li>

<ul>
<li>Reference cycles occur when two or more values have references to each other, creating a cycle that cannot be dropped by the memory allocator.</li>
<li>Reference cycles can cause memory leaks and unexpected behavior in Rust programs.</li>
<li>Rust’s ownership and borrowing system prevents most types of reference cycles, but they can still occur with the use of Rc<T> and RefCell<T> types.</li>
<li>Rc<T> is a reference-counted smart pointer type that allows multiple owners of the same value, but it can create reference cycles if used incorrectly.</li>
<li>RefCell<T> is a type that allows for mutable borrowing of an immutable value, but it can also create reference cycles if used incorrectly.</li>
<li>Rust provides the Weak<T> type to break reference cycles created by Rc<T>. Weak references do not contribute to the reference count, so they do not prevent the value from being dropped.</li>
<li>Another way to break reference cycles is to use std::mem::take() function to take ownership of a value and leave behind a default value, which will drop the original value if it was the only owner.</li>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-25: A cons list definition that holds a

<p>We’re using another variation of the <code>List</code> definition from Listing 15-5. The
second element in the <code>Cons</code> variant is now <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code>, meaning that
instead of having the ability to modify the <code>i32</code> value as we did in Listing
15-24, we want to modify the <code>List</code> value a <code>Cons</code> variant is pointing to.
We’re also adding a <code>tail</code> method to make it convenient for us to access the
second item if we have a <code>Cons</code> variant.</p>
<p>In Listing 15-26, we’re adding a <code>main</code> function that uses the definitions in
Listing 15-25. This code creates a list in <code>a</code> and a list in <code>b</code> that points to
the list in <code>a</code>. Then it modifies the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>, creating a
reference cycle. There are <code>println!</code> statements along the way to show what the
reference counts are at various points in this process.</p>

<p>We create an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance holding a <code>List</code> value in the variable <code>a</code>
with an initial list of <code>5, Nil</code>. We then create an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance holding

<p>We modify <code>a</code> so it points to <code>b</code> instead of <code>Nil</code>, creating a cycle. We do
that by using the <code>tail</code> method to get a reference to the <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code>

method on the <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code> to change the value inside from an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code>
that holds a <code>Nil</code> value to the <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> in <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>When we run this code, keeping the last <code>println!</code> commented out for the
moment, we’ll get this output:</p>

b initial rc count = 1
b next item = Some(RefCell { value: Cons(5, RefCell { value: Nil }) })
b rc count after changing a = 2

</code></pre>
<p>The reference count of the <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instances in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are 2 after
we change the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>. At the end of <code>main</code>, Rust drops the
variable <code>b</code>, which decreases the reference count of the <code>b</code> <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance
from 2 to 1. The memory that <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> has on the heap won’t be dropped at
this point, because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then Rust drops <code>a</code>, which
decreases the reference count of the <code>a</code> <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance from 2 to 1 as
well. This instance’s memory can’t be dropped either, because the other
<code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance still refers to it. The memory allocated to the list will
remain uncollected forever. To visualize this reference cycle, we’ve created a
diagram in Figure 15-4.</p>
<img alt="Reference cycle of lists" src="img/trpl15-04.svg" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 15-4: A reference cycle of lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
pointing to each other</span></p>
<p>If you uncomment the last <code>println!</code> and run the program, Rust will try to
print this cycle with <code>a</code> pointing to <code>b</code> pointing to <code>a</code> and so forth until it
overflows the stack.</p>
<p>Compared to a real-world program, the consequences creating a reference cycle
in this example aren’t very dire: right after we create the reference cycle,
the program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of memory
in a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more memory
than it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of
available memory.</p>
<p>Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it’s not impossible either.
If you have <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> values that contain <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values or similar nested
combinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must
ensure that you don’t create cycles; you can’t rely on Rust to catch them.
Creating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should
use automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to
minimize.</p>
<p>Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data
structures so that some references express ownership and some references don’t.
As a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership relationships and
some non-ownership relationships, and only the ownership relationships affect
whether or not a value can be dropped. In Listing 15-25, we always want <code>Cons</code>
variants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure isn’t possible.
Let’s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes
to see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent
reference cycles.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-reference-cycles-turning-an-rct-into-a-weakt"><a class="header" href="#preventing-reference-cycles-turning-an-rct-into-a-weakt">Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> into a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>So far, we’ve demonstrated that calling <code>Rc::clone</code> increases the
<code>strong_count</code> of an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance, and an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance is only cleaned
up if its <code>strong_count</code> is 0. You can also create a <em>weak reference</em> to the
value within an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance by calling <code>Rc::downgrade</code> and passing a
reference to the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Strong references are how you can share ownership of
an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance. Weak references don’t express an ownership relationship,
and their count doesn’t affect when an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance is cleaned up. They
won’t cause a reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references
will be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.</p>
<p>When you call <code>Rc::downgrade</code>, you get a smart pointer of type <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Instead of increasing the <code>strong_count</code> in the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance by 1, calling
<code>Rc::downgrade</code> increases the <code>weak_count</code> by 1. The <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type uses
<code>weak_count</code> to keep track of how many <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references exist, similar to
<code>strong_count</code>. The difference is the <code>weak_count</code> doesn’t need to be 0 for the
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>Because the value that <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references might have been dropped, to do
anything with the value that a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> is pointing to, you must make sure the
value still exists. Do this by calling the <code>upgrade</code> method on a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>
instance, which will return an <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. You’ll get a result of <code>Some</code>
if the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value has not been dropped yet and a result of <code>None</code> if the
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value has been dropped. Because <code>upgrade</code> returns an <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
Rust will ensure that the <code>Some</code> case and the <code>None</code> case are handled, and
there won’t be an invalid pointer.</p>
<p>As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next
item, we’ll create a tree whose items know about their children items <em>and</em>
their parent items.</p>

<p>To start, we’ll build a tree with nodes that know about their child nodes.
We’ll create a struct named <code>Node</code> that holds its own <code>i32</code> value as well as

<p>We want a <code>Node</code> to own its children, and we want to share that ownership with

define the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> items to be values of type <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code>. We also want to
modify which nodes are children of another node, so we have a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in

<p>Next, we’ll use our struct definition and create one <code>Node</code> instance named

with the value 5 and <code>leaf</code> as one of its children, as shown in Listing 15-27:</p>

<p>We clone the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> in <code>leaf</code> and store that in <code>branch</code>, meaning the
<code>Node</code> in <code>leaf</code> now has two owners: <code>leaf</code> and <code>branch</code>. We can get from
<code>branch</code> to <code>leaf</code> through <code>branch.children</code>, but there’s no way to get from
<code>leaf</code> to <code>branch</code>. The reason is that <code>leaf</code> has no reference to <code>branch</code> and
doesn’t know they’re related. We want <code>leaf</code> to know that <code>branch</code> is its
parent. We’ll do that next.</p>
<h4 id="adding-a-reference-from-a-child-to-its-parent"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-reference-from-a-child-to-its-parent">Adding a Reference from a Child to Its Parent</a></h4>
<p>To make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a <code>parent</code> field to
our <code>Node</code> struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of
<code>parent</code> should be. We know it can’t contain an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, because that would
create a reference cycle with <code>leaf.parent</code> pointing to <code>branch</code> and
<code>branch.children</code> pointing to <code>leaf</code>, which would cause their <code>strong_count</code>
values to never be 0.</p>
<p>Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its
children: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as
well. However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the
parent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!</p>
<p>So instead of <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, we’ll make the type of <code>parent</code> use <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>,
specifically a <code>RefCell&lt;Weak&lt;Node&gt;&gt;</code>. Now our <code>Node</code> struct definition looks

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-28: A <code>leaf</code> node with a weak reference to its

<p>Creating the <code>leaf</code> node looks similar to Listing 15-27 with the exception of
the <code>parent</code> field: <code>leaf</code> starts out without a parent, so we create a new,
empty <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code> reference instance.</p>
<p>At this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of <code>leaf</code> by using
the <code>upgrade</code> method, we get a <code>None</code> value. We see this in the output from the
first <code>println!</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">leaf parent = None
</code></pre>
<p>When we create the <code>branch</code> node, it will also have a new <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code>
reference in the <code>parent</code> field, because <code>branch</code> doesn’t have a parent node.
We still have <code>leaf</code> as one of the children of <code>branch</code>. Once we have the
<code>Node</code> instance in <code>branch</code>, we can modify <code>leaf</code> to give it a <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code>
reference to its parent. We use the <code>borrow_mut</code> method on the
<code>RefCell&lt;Weak&lt;Node&gt;&gt;</code> in the <code>parent</code> field of <code>leaf</code>, and then we use the
<code>Rc::downgrade</code> function to create a <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code> reference to <code>branch</code> from
the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> in <code>branch.</code></p>
<p>When we print the parent of <code>leaf</code> again, this time we’ll get a <code>Some</code> variant
holding <code>branch</code>: now <code>leaf</code> can access its parent! When we print <code>leaf</code>, we
also avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow like we had in
Listing 15-26; the <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code> references are printed as <code>(Weak)</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">leaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [Node { value: 3, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [] } }] } })
</code></pre>
<p>The lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn’t create a reference
cycle. We can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling
<code>Rc::strong_count</code> and <code>Rc::weak_count</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how the <code>strong_count</code> and <code>weak_count</code> values of the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code>

<code>branch</code> into that scope. By doing so, we can see what happens when <code>branch</code> is

examining strong and weak reference counts</span></p>
<p>After <code>leaf</code> is created, its <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> has a strong count of 1 and a weak
count of 0. In the inner scope, we create <code>branch</code> and associate it with
<code>leaf</code>, at which point when we print the counts, the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> in <code>branch</code>
will have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1 (for <code>leaf.parent</code> pointing
to <code>branch</code> with a <code>Weak&lt;Node&gt;</code>). When we print the counts in <code>leaf</code>, we’ll see
it will have a strong count of 2, because <code>branch</code> now has a clone of the
<code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> of <code>leaf</code> stored in <code>branch.children</code>, but will still have a weak
count of 0.</p>
<p>When the inner scope ends, <code>branch</code> goes out of scope and the strong count of
the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> decreases to 0, so its <code>Node</code> is dropped. The weak count of 1
from <code>leaf.parent</code> has no bearing on whether or not <code>Node</code> is dropped, so we
don’t get any memory leaks!</p>
<p>If we try to access the parent of <code>leaf</code> after the end of the scope, we’ll get
<code>None</code> again. At the end of the program, the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> in <code>leaf</code> has a strong
count of 1 and a weak count of 0, because the variable <code>leaf</code> is now the only
reference to the <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code> again.</p>
<p>All of the logic that manages the counts and value dropping is built into
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> and their implementations of the <code>Drop</code> trait. By
specifying that the relationship from a child to its parent should be a
<code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> reference in the definition of <code>Node</code>, you’re able to have parent
nodes point to child nodes and vice versa without creating a reference cycle
and memory leaks.</p>
<h3 id="summary-15"><a class="header" href="#summary-15">Summary</a></h3>
<p>This chapter covered how to use smart pointers to make different guarantees and
trade-offs from those Rust makes by default with regular references. The
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> type has a known size and points to data allocated on the heap. The
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type keeps track of the number of references to data on the heap so
that data can have multiple owners. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type with its interior
mutability gives us a type that we can use when we need an immutable type but
need to change an inner value of that type; it also enforces the borrowing
rules at runtime instead of at compile time.</p>
<p>Also discussed were the <code>Deref</code> and <code>Drop</code> traits, which enable a lot of the
functionality of smart pointers. We explored reference cycles that can cause
memory leaks and how to prevent them using <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

smart pointers, check out <a href="../nomicon/index.html">“The Rustonomicon”</a> for more useful
information.</p>

<li>Reference cycles occur when two or more values have references to each other, creating a cycle that cannot be dropped by the memory allocator. They are problematic because they can cause memory leaks and unexpected behavior in Rust programs.</li>
<li>Rust’s ownership and borrowing system prevents most types of reference cycles by enforcing strict rules for how values can be borrowed and moved. For example, Rust does not allow mutable aliases or aliasing across mutable borrows, which can help prevent reference cycles.</li>
<li>Rc<T> is a reference-counted smart pointer type that allows multiple owners of the same value. If two Rc<T> values reference each other, or if an Rc<T> value references a RefCell<T> that contains an Rc<T> value that references it, a reference cycle can be created.</li>
<li>Rust’s Weak<T> type is a weak reference that does not contribute to the reference count, so it can be used to break reference cycles created by Rc<T>. Weak<T> values can be created from Rc<T> values and used to access the value’s data without keeping the value alive.</li>
<li>std::mem::take() is a function that takes ownership of a value and leaves behind a default value, which can be used to break reference cycles. If a value is only owned by a reference cycle, calling std::mem::take() will drop the value and create a new default value in its place.</li>
<li>One potential issue with using std::mem::take() is that it can lead to unexpected behavior if the value is not meant to be reset to its default state. Additionally, using std::mem::take() may not be as efficient as breaking the reference cycle in other ways, such as using Weak<T>.</li>
<li>No, regular references (i.e., &amp;T) cannot create reference cycles because they do not have ownership. Regular references are borrowed pointers that do not affect the lifetime of the value they point to.</li>
<li>Debugging reference cycles in Rust programs can be challenging because they can cause memory leaks and other unexpected behavior. Some tools and techniques that can be used to debug reference cycles include analyzing heap allocations with profilers, using Rust’s Debug and Drop traits to log reference counts and deallocations, and using Rust’s borrow checker to ensure that reference cycles are not created in the first place.</li>
<li>RefCell<T> can create a reference cycle if it contains an Rc<T> value that references it. For example, if you have a RefCell&lt;Rc<T>&gt; value that contains an Rc<T> value that references the RefCell, a reference cycle can be created.</li>
<li>You might choose to use Rc<T> instead of regular references or Box<T> when you need to share ownership of a value across multiple parts of your program. Rc<T> allows multiple owners to access the same value, which can be useful for scenarios like creating a tree structure. However, Rc<T> has some potential drawbacks, such as the possibility of creating reference cycles and the overhead of reference counting.</li>

<p>Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rust’s
major goals. <em>Concurrent programming</em>, where different parts of a program
execute independently, and <em>parallel programming</em>, where different parts of a
program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more
computers take advantage of their multiple processors. Historically,
programming in these contexts has been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to
change that.</p>
<p>Initially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and preventing
concurrency problems were two separate challenges to be solved with different
methods. Over time, the team discovered that the ownership and type systems are
a powerful set of tools to help manage memory safety <em>and</em> concurrency
problems! By leveraging ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors
are compile-time errors in Rust rather than runtime errors. Therefore, rather
than making you spend lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances
under which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to
compile and present an error explaining the problem. As a result, you can fix
your code while you’re working on it rather than potentially after it has been
shipped to production. We’ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust <em>fearless</em>
<em>concurrency</em>. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that is free of
subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For simplicity’s sake, we’ll refer to many of the problems as
<em>concurrent</em> rather than being more precise by saying <em>concurrent and/or
parallel</em>. If this book were about concurrency and/or parallelism, we’d be
more specific. For this chapter, please mentally substitute <em>concurrent
and/or parallel</em> whenever we use <em>concurrent</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling
concurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for
message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between
threads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable
strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level language promises
benefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level
languages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any
given situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware. Therefore, Rust
offers a variety of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate
for your situation and requirements.</p>
<p>Here are the topics we’ll cover in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time</li>
<li><em>Message-passing</em> concurrency, where channels send messages between threads</li>
<li><em>Shared-state</em> concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece
of data</li>
<li>The <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code> traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to
user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="using-threads-to-run-code-simultaneously"><a class="header" href="#using-threads-to-run-code-simultaneously">Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously</a></h2>
<p>In most current operating systems, an executed program’s code is run in a
<em>process</em>, and the operating system will manage multiple processes at once.
Within a program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously.
The features that run these independent parts are called <em>threads</em>. For
example, a web server could have multiple threads so that it could respond to
more than one request at the same time.</p>
<p>Splitting the computation in your program into multiple threads to run multiple
tasks at the same time can improve performance, but it also adds complexity.
Because threads can run simultaneously, there’s no inherent guarantee about the
order in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead
to problems, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in an
inconsistent order</li>
<li>Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both
threads from continuing</li>
<li>Bugs that happen only in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix
reliably</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust attempts to mitigate the negative effects of using threads, but
programming in a multithreaded context still takes careful thought and requires
a code structure that is different from that in programs running in a single
thread.</p>
<p>Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and many
operating systems provide an API the language can call for creating new
threads. The Rust standard library uses a <em>1:1</em> model of thread implementation,
whereby a program uses one operating system thread per one language thread.
There are crates that implement other models of threading that make different
tradeoffs to the 1:1 model.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-thread-with-spawn"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-thread-with-spawn">Creating a New Thread with <code>spawn</code></a></h3>
<p>To create a new thread, we call the <code>thread::spawn</code> function and pass it a
closure (we talked about closures in Chapter 13) containing the code we want to
run in the new thread. The example in Listing 16-1 prints some text from a main
thread and other text from a new thread:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!(&quot;hi number {} from the spawned thread!&quot;, i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!(&quot;hi number {} from the main thread!&quot;, i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-1: Creating a new thread to print one thing
while the main thread prints something else</span></p>
<p>Note that when the main thread of a Rust program completes, all spawned threads
are shut down, whether or not they have finished running. The output from this
program might be a little different every time, but it will look similar to the
following:</p>

<p>The calls to <code>thread::sleep</code> force a thread to stop its execution for a short
duration, allowing a different thread to run. The threads will probably take
turns, but that isn’t guaranteed: it depends on how your operating system
schedules the threads. In this run, the main thread printed first, even though
the print statement from the spawned thread appears first in the code. And even
though we told the spawned thread to print until <code>i</code> is 9, it only got to 5
before the main thread shut down.</p>
<p>If you run this code and only see output from the main thread, or don’t see any
overlap, try increasing the numbers in the ranges to create more opportunities
for the operating system to switch between the threads.</p>

<p>The code in Listing 16-1 not only stops the spawned thread prematurely most of

<p>We can fix the problem of the spawned thread not running or ending prematurely
by saving the return value of <code>thread::spawn</code> in a variable. The return type of
<code>thread::spawn</code> is <code>JoinHandle</code>. A <code>JoinHandle</code> is an owned value that, when we
call the <code>join</code> method on it, will wait for its thread to finish. Listing 16-2
shows how to use the <code>JoinHandle</code> of the thread we created in Listing 16-1 and
call <code>join</code> to make sure the spawned thread finishes before <code>main</code> exits:</p>

<p>Calling <code>join</code> on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the

<p>We’ll often use the <code>move</code> keyword with closures passed to <code>thread::spawn</code>
because the closure will then take ownership of the values it uses from the

another. In the <a href="ch13-01-closures.html#capturing-references-or-moving-ownership">“Capturing References or Moving Ownership”</a><!-- ignore

we’ll concentrate more on the interaction between <code>move</code> and <code>thread::spawn</code>.</p>
<p>Notice in Listing 16-1 that the closure we pass to <code>thread::spawn</code> takes no
arguments: we’re not using any data from the main thread in the spawned
thread’s code. To use data from the main thread in the spawned thread, the
spawned thread’s closure must capture the values it needs. Listing 16-3 shows
an attempt to create a vector in the main thread and use it in the spawned
thread. However, this won’t yet work, as you’ll see in a moment.</p>

<p>Rust’s ownership rules have saved us again! We got an error from the code in
Listing 16-3 because Rust was being conservative and only borrowing <code>v</code> for the
thread, which meant the main thread could theoretically invalidate the spawned
thread’s reference. By telling Rust to move ownership of <code>v</code> to the spawned
thread, we’re guaranteeing Rust that the main thread won’t use <code>v</code> anymore. If
we change Listing 16-4 in the same way, we’re then violating the ownership
rules when we try to use <code>v</code> in the main thread. The <code>move</code> keyword overrides
Rust’s conservative default of borrowing; it doesn’t let us violate the
ownership rules.</p>
<p>With a basic understanding of threads and the thread API, let’s look at what we
can <em>do</em> with threads.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="using-message-passing-to-transfer-data-between-threads"><a class="header" href="#using-message-passing-to-transfer-data-between-threads">Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads</a></h2>
<p>One increasingly popular approach to ensuring safe concurrency is <em>message
passing</em>, where threads or actors communicate by sending each other messages
containing data. Here’s the idea in a slogan from <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">the Go language
documentation</a>:
“Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.”</p>
<p>To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust’s standard library provides an
implementation of <em>channels</em>. A channel is a general programming concept by
which data is sent from one thread to another.</p>
<p>You can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional channel of
water, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck
into a river, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.</p>
<p>A channel has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter half is
the upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river, and the
receiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your
code calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and
another part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said
to be <em>closed</em> if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values and
send them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and
print them out. We’ll be sending simple values between threads using a channel
to illustrate the feature. Once you’re familiar with the technique, you could
use channels for any threads that need to communicate between each other, such
as a chat system or a system where many threads perform parts of a calculation
and send the parts to one thread that aggregates the results.</p>
<p>First, in Listing 16-6, we’ll create a channel but not do anything with it.
Note that this won’t compile yet because Rust can’t tell what type of values we
want to send over the channel.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-6: Creating a channel and assigning the two
halves to <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code></span></p>
<p>We create a new channel using the <code>mpsc::channel</code> function; <code>mpsc</code> stands for
<em>multiple producer, single consumer</em>. In short, the way Rust’s standard library
implements channels means a channel can have multiple <em>sending</em> ends that
produce values but only one <em>receiving</em> end that consumes those values. Imagine
multiple streams flowing together into one big river: everything sent down any
of the streams will end up in one river at the end. We’ll start with a single
producer for now, but we’ll add multiple producers when we get this example
working.</p>
<p>The <code>mpsc::channel</code> function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the
sending end–the transmitter–and the second element is the receiving end–the
receiver. The abbreviations <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code> are traditionally used in many fields
for <em>transmitter</em> and <em>receiver</em> respectively, so we name our variables as such
to indicate each end. We’re using a <code>let</code> statement with a pattern that
destructures the tuples; we’ll discuss the use of patterns in <code>let</code> statements
and destructuring in Chapter 18. For now, know that using a <code>let</code> statement
this way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of the tuple returned
by <code>mpsc::channel</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one
string so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as shown in
Listing 16-7. This is like putting a rubber duck in the river upstream or
sending a chat message from one thread to another.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-7: Moving <code>tx</code> to a spawned thread and sending
“hi”</span></p>
<p>Again, we’re using <code>thread::spawn</code> to create a new thread and then using <code>move</code>
to move <code>tx</code> into the closure so the spawned thread owns <code>tx</code>. The spawned
thread needs to own the transmitter to be able to send messages through the
channel. The transmitter has a <code>send</code> method that takes the value we want to
send. The <code>send</code> method returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type, so if the receiver has
already been dropped and there’s nowhere to send a value, the send operation
will return an error. In this example, we’re calling <code>unwrap</code> to panic in case
of an error. But in a real application, we would handle it properly: return to
Chapter 9 to review strategies for proper error handling.</p>
<p>In Listing 16-8, we’ll get the value from the receiver in the main thread. This
is like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the end of the river or
receiving a chat message.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!(&quot;Got: {}&quot;, received);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-8: Receiving the value “hi” in the main thread
and printing it</span></p>
<p>The receiver has two useful methods: <code>recv</code> and <code>try_recv</code>. We’re using <code>recv</code>,
short for <em>receive</em>, which will block the main thread’s execution and wait
until a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is sent, <code>recv</code> will
return it in a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. When the transmitter closes, <code>recv</code> will return
an error to signal that no more values will be coming.</p>
<p>The <code>try_recv</code> method doesn’t block, but will instead return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>
immediately: an <code>Ok</code> value holding a message if one is available and an <code>Err</code>
value if there aren’t any messages this time. Using <code>try_recv</code> is useful if
this thread has other work to do while waiting for messages: we could write a
loop that calls <code>try_recv</code> every so often, handles a message if one is
available, and otherwise does other work for a little while until checking
again.</p>
<p>We’ve used <code>recv</code> in this example for simplicity; we don’t have any other work
for the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so blocking the main
thread is appropriate.</p>
<p>When we run the code in Listing 16-8, we’ll see the value printed from the main
thread:</p>

<h3 id="channels-and-ownership-transference"><a class="header" href="#channels-and-ownership-transference">Channels and Ownership Transference</a></h3>
<p>The ownership rules play a vital role in message sending because they help you
write safe, concurrent code. Preventing errors in concurrent programming is the
advantage of thinking about ownership throughout your Rust programs. Let’s do
an experiment to show how channels and ownership work together to prevent
problems: we’ll try to use a <code>val</code> value in the spawned thread <em>after</em> we’ve
sent it down the channel. Try compiling the code in Listing 16-9 to see why
this code isn’t allowed:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
        println!(&quot;val is {}&quot;, val);

<p>Here, we try to print <code>val</code> after we’ve sent it down the channel via <code>tx.send</code>.
Allowing this would be a bad idea: once the value has been sent to another
thread, that thread could modify or drop it before we try to use the value
again. Potentially, the other thread’s modifications could cause errors or
unexpected results due to inconsistent or nonexistent data. However, Rust gives
us an error if we try to compile the code in Listing 16-9:</p>

error: could not compile `message-passing` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Our concurrency mistake has caused a compile time error. The <code>send</code> function
takes ownership of its parameter, and when the value is moved, the receiver
takes ownership of it. This stops us from accidentally using the value again
after sending it; the ownership system checks that everything is okay.</p>

<p>The code in Listing 16-8 compiled and ran, but it didn’t clearly show us that
two separate threads were talking to each other over the channel. In Listing
16-10 we’ve made some modifications that will prove the code in Listing 16-8 is
running concurrently: the spawned thread will now send multiple messages and
pause for a second between each message.</p>

<p>This time, the spawned thread has a vector of strings that we want to send to

between each by calling the <code>thread::sleep</code> function with a <code>Duration</code> value of
1 second.</p>
<p>In the main thread, we’re not calling the <code>recv</code> function explicitly anymore:
instead, we’re treating <code>rx</code> as an iterator. For each value received, we’re

<p>This time, before we create the first spawned thread, we call <code>clone</code> on the
transmitter. This will give us a new transmitter we can pass to the first
spawned thread. We pass the original transmitter to a second spawned thread.
This gives us two threads, each sending different messages to the one receiver.</p>
<p>When you run the code, your output should look something like this:</p>
<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;

</code></pre>
<p>You might see the values in another order, depending on your system. This is
what makes concurrency interesting as well as difficult. If you experiment with
<code>thread::sleep</code>, giving it various values in the different threads, each run
will be more nondeterministic and create different output each time.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve looked at how channels work, let’s look at a different method of
concurrency.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="shared-state-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#shared-state-concurrency">Shared-State Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>Message passing is a fine way of handling concurrency, but it’s not the only
one. Another method would be for multiple threads to access the same shared
data. Consider this part of the slogan from the Go language documentation
again: “do not communicate by sharing memory.”</p>
<p>What would communicating by sharing memory look like? In addition, why would
message-passing enthusiasts caution not to use memory sharing?</p>
<p>In a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single ownership,
because once you transfer a value down a channel, you should no longer use that
value. Shared memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: multiple threads
can access the same memory location at the same time. As you saw in Chapter 15,
where smart pointers made multiple ownership possible, multiple ownership can
add complexity because these different owners need managing. Rust’s type system
and ownership rules greatly assist in getting this management correct. For an
example, let’s look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives
for shared memory.</p>
<h3 id="using-mutexes-to-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time"><a class="header" href="#using-mutexes-to-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time">Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time</a></h3>
<p><em>Mutex</em> is an abbreviation for <em>mutual exclusion</em>, as in, a mutex allows only
one thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a
mutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the
mutex’s <em>lock</em>. The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that
keeps track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the
mutex is described as <em>guarding</em> the data it holds via the locking system.</p>
<p>Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to
remember two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.</li>
<li>When you’re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the
data so other threads can acquire the lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a
conference with only one microphone. Before a panelist can speak, they have to
ask or signal that they want to use the microphone. When they get the
microphone, they can talk for as long as they want to and then hand the
microphone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to
hand the microphone off when they’re finished with it, no one else is able to
speak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel won’t work
as planned!</p>
<p>Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why so
many people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust’s type
system and ownership rules, you can’t get locking and unlocking wrong.</p>
<h4 id="the-api-of-mutext"><a class="header" href="#the-api-of-mutext">The API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h4>
<p>As an example of how to use a mutex, let’s start by using a mutex in a
single-threaded context, as shown in Listing 16-12:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);

    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }

    println!(&quot;m = {:?}&quot;, m);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-12: Exploring the API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> in a
single-threaded context for simplicity</span></p>
<p>As with many types, we create a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> using the associated function <code>new</code>.
To access the data inside the mutex, we use the <code>lock</code> method to acquire the
lock. This call will block the current thread so it can’t do any work until
it’s our turn to have the lock.</p>
<p>The call to <code>lock</code> would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. In
that case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we’ve chosen to
<code>unwrap</code> and have this thread panic if we’re in that situation.</p>
<p>After we’ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named <code>num</code> in
this case, as a mutable reference to the data inside. The type system ensures
that we acquire a lock before using the value in <code>m</code>. The type of <code>m</code> is
<code>Mutex&lt;i32&gt;</code>, not <code>i32</code>, so we <em>must</em> call <code>lock</code> to be able to use the <code>i32</code>
value. We can’t forget; the type system won’t let us access the inner <code>i32</code>
otherwise.</p>
<p>As you might suspect, <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is a smart pointer. More accurately, the call
to <code>lock</code> <em>returns</em> a smart pointer called <code>MutexGuard</code>, wrapped in a
<code>LockResult</code> that we handled with the call to <code>unwrap</code>. The <code>MutexGuard</code> smart
pointer implements <code>Deref</code> to point at our inner data; the smart pointer also
has a <code>Drop</code> implementation that releases the lock automatically when a
<code>MutexGuard</code> goes out of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope. As
a result, we don’t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex
from being used by other threads, because the lock release happens
automatically.</p>
<p>After dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we were able
to change the inner <code>i32</code> to 6.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads"><a class="header" href="#sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads">Sharing a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> Between Multiple Threads</a></h4>
<p>Now, let’s try to share a value between multiple threads using <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>.
We’ll spin up 10 threads and have them each increment a counter value by 1, so
the counter goes from 0 to 10. The next example in Listing 16-13 will have
a compiler error, and we’ll use that error to learn more about using
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and how Rust helps us use it correctly.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">use std::sync::Mutex;

            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!(&quot;Result: {}&quot;, *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-13: Ten threads each increment a counter
guarded by a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></span></p>
<p>We create a <code>counter</code> variable to hold an <code>i32</code> inside a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, as we did
in Listing 16-12. Next, we create 10 threads by iterating over a range of
numbers. We use <code>thread::spawn</code> and give all the threads the same closure: one
that moves the counter into the thread, acquires a lock on the <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> by
calling the <code>lock</code> method, and then adds 1 to the value in the mutex. When a
thread finishes running its closure, <code>num</code> will go out of scope and release the
lock so another thread can acquire it.</p>
<p>In the main thread, we collect all the join handles. Then, as we did in Listing
16-2, we call <code>join</code> on each handle to make sure all the threads finish. At
that point, the main thread will acquire the lock and print the result of this
program.</p>
<p>We hinted that this example wouldn’t compile. Now let’s find out why!</p>

error: could not compile `shared-state` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that error message is very wordy! Here’s the important part to focus on:
<code>`Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;` cannot be sent between threads safely</code>. The compiler is
also telling us the reason why: <code>the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;` </code>. We’ll talk about <code>Send</code> in the next section: it’s one of
the traits that ensures the types we use with threads are meant for use in
concurrent situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is not safe to share across threads. When <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>
manages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call to <code>clone</code> and
subtracts from the count when each clone is dropped. But it doesn’t use any
concurrency primitives to make sure that changes to the count can’t be
interrupted by another thread. This could lead to wrong counts—subtle bugs that
could in turn lead to memory leaks or a value being dropped before we’re done
with it. What we need is a type exactly like <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> but one that makes changes
to the reference count in a thread-safe way.</p>
<h4 id="atomic-reference-counting-with-arct"><a class="header" href="#atomic-reference-counting-with-arct">Atomic Reference Counting with <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h4>
<p>Fortunately, <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> <em>is</em> a type like <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that is safe to use in
concurrent situations. The <em>a</em> stands for <em>atomic</em>, meaning it’s an <em>atomically
reference counted</em> type. Atomics are an additional kind of concurrency
primitive that we won’t cover in detail here: see the standard library
documentation for <a href="../std/sync/atomic/index.html"><code>std::sync::atomic</code></a><!-- ignore --> for more
details. At this point, you just need to know that atomics work like primitive
types but are safe to share across threads.</p>
<p>You might then wonder why all primitive types aren’t atomic and why standard
library types aren’t implemented to use <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> by default. The reason is that
thread safety comes with a performance penalty that you only want to pay when
you really need to. If you’re just performing operations on values within a
single thread, your code can run faster if it doesn’t have to enforce the
guarantees atomics provide.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our example: <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> have the same API, so we fix
our program by changing the <code>use</code> line, the call to <code>new</code>, and the call to
<code>clone</code>. The code in Listing 16-15 will finally compile and run:</p>

<p>We did it! We counted from 0 to 10, which may not seem very impressive, but it
did teach us a lot about <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and thread safety. You could also use this
program’s structure to do more complicated operations than just incrementing a
counter. Using this strategy, you can divide a calculation into independent
parts, split those parts across threads, and then use a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> to have each
thread update the final result with its part.</p>
<p>Note that if you are doing simple numerical operations, there are types simpler
than <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> types provided by the <a href="../std/sync/atomic/index.html"><code>std::sync::atomic</code> module of the
standard library</a><!-- ignore -->. These types provide safe, concurrent,
atomic access to primitive types. We chose to use <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> with a primitive
type for this example so we could concentrate on how <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> works.</p>
<h3 id="similarities-between-refcelltrct-and-mutextarct"><a class="header" href="#similarities-between-refcelltrct-and-mutextarct">Similarities Between <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>You might have noticed that <code>counter</code> is immutable but we could get a mutable
reference to the value inside it; this means <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> provides interior
mutability, as the <code>Cell</code> family does. In the same way we used <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in
Chapter 15 to allow us to mutate contents inside an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, we use <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>
to mutate contents inside an <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Another detail to note is that Rust can’t protect you from all kinds of logic
errors when you use <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>. Recall in Chapter 15 that using <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> came
with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values refer to
each other, causing memory leaks. Similarly, <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> comes with the risk of
creating <em>deadlocks</em>. These occur when an operation needs to lock two resources
and two threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for
each other forever. If you’re interested in deadlocks, try creating a Rust
program that has a deadlock; then research deadlock mitigation strategies for
mutexes in any language and have a go at implementing them in Rust. The
standard library API documentation for <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>MutexGuard</code> offers
useful information.</p>
<p>We’ll round out this chapter by talking about the <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> traits and
how we can use them with custom types.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Rust language has <em>very</em> few concurrency features. Almost
every concurrency feature we’ve talked about so far in this chapter has been
part of the standard library, not the language. Your options for handling
concurrency are not limited to the language or the standard library; you can
write your own concurrency features or use those written by others.</p>
<p>However, two concurrency concepts are embedded in the language: the

<code>Send</code> because if you cloned an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value and tried to transfer ownership
of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count
at the same time. For this reason, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is implemented for use in
single-threaded situations where you don’t want to pay the thread-safe
performance penalty.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rust’s type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never
accidentally send an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value across threads unsafely. When we tried to do
this in Listing 16-14, we got the error <code>the trait Send is not implemented for Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code>. When we switched to <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is <code>Send</code>, the code
compiled.</p>
<p>Any type composed entirely of <code>Send</code> types is automatically marked as <code>Send</code> as
well. Almost all primitive types are <code>Send</code>, aside from raw pointers, which
we’ll discuss in Chapter 19.</p>
<h3 id="allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync"><a class="header" href="#allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync">Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with <code>Sync</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing
<code>Sync</code> to be referenced from multiple threads. In other words, any type <code>T</code> is
<code>Sync</code> if <code>&amp;T</code> (an immutable reference to <code>T</code>) is <code>Send</code>, meaning the reference
can be sent safely to another thread. Similar to <code>Send</code>, primitive types are
<code>Sync</code>, and types composed entirely of types that are <code>Sync</code> are also <code>Sync</code>.</p>
<p>The smart pointer <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is also not <code>Sync</code> for the same reasons that it’s not
<code>Send</code>. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type (which we talked about in Chapter 15) and the
family of related <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> types are not <code>Sync</code>. The implementation of borrow
checking that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> does at runtime is not thread-safe. The smart
pointer <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>Sync</code> and can be used to share access with multiple
threads as you saw in the <a href="ch16-03-shared-state.html#sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads">“Sharing a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> Between Multiple
Threads”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-send-and-sync-manually-is-unsafe"><a class="header" href="#implementing-send-and-sync-manually-is-unsafe">Implementing <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> Manually Is Unsafe</a></h3>
<p>Because types that are made up of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> traits are automatically
also <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, we don’t have to implement those traits manually. As
marker traits, they don’t even have any methods to implement. They’re just
useful for enforcing invariants related to concurrency.</p>
<p>Manually implementing these traits involves implementing unsafe Rust code.
We’ll talk about using unsafe Rust code in Chapter 19; for now, the important
information is that building new concurrent types not made up of <code>Send</code> and
<code>Sync</code> parts requires careful thought to uphold the safety guarantees. <a href="../nomicon/index.html">“The
Rustonomicon”</a> has more information about these guarantees and how to
uphold them.</p>
<h2 id="summary-16"><a class="header" href="#summary-16">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This isn’t the last you’ll see of concurrency in this book: the project in
Chapter 20 will use the concepts in this chapter in a more realistic situation
than the smaller examples discussed here.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, because very little of how Rust handles concurrency is
part of the language, many concurrency solutions are implemented as crates.
These evolve more quickly than the standard library, so be sure to search
online for the current, state-of-the-art crates to use in multithreaded
situations.</p>
<p>The Rust standard library provides channels for message passing and smart
pointer types, such as <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, that are safe to use in
concurrent contexts. The type system and the borrow checker ensure that the
code using these solutions won’t end up with data races or invalid references.
Once you get your code to compile, you can rest assured that it will happily
run on multiple threads without the kinds of hard-to-track-down bugs common in
other languages. Concurrent programming is no longer a concept to be afraid of:
go forth and make your programs concurrent, fearlessly!</p>
<p>Next, we’ll talk about idiomatic ways to model problems and structure solutions
as your Rust programs get bigger. In addition, we’ll discuss how Rust’s idioms
relate to those you might be familiar with from object-oriented programming.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="object-oriented-programming-features-of-rust"><a class="header" href="#object-oriented-programming-features-of-rust">Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust</a></h1>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of modeling programs. Objects as a
programmatic concept were introduced in the programming language Simula in the
1960s. Those objects influenced Alan Kay’s programming architecture in which
objects pass messages to each other. To describe this architecture, he coined
the term <em>object-oriented programming</em> in 1967. Many competing definitions
describe what OOP is, and by some of these definitions Rust is object-oriented,
but by others it is not. In this chapter, we’ll explore certain characteristics
that are commonly considered object-oriented and how those characteristics
translate to idiomatic Rust. We’ll then show you how to implement an
object-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the trade-offs of doing so
versus implementing a solution using some of Rust’s strengths instead.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="characteristics-of-object-oriented-languages"><a class="header" href="#characteristics-of-object-oriented-languages">Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages</a></h2>
<p>There is no consensus in the programming community about what features a
language must have to be considered object-oriented. Rust is influenced by many
programming paradigms, including OOP; for example, we explored the features
that came from functional programming in Chapter 13. Arguably, OOP languages
share certain common characteristics, namely objects, encapsulation, and
inheritance. Let’s look at what each of those characteristics means and whether
Rust supports it.</p>
<h3 id="objects-contain-data-and-behavior"><a class="header" href="#objects-contain-data-and-behavior">Objects Contain Data and Behavior</a></h3>
<p>The book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em> by
Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Addison-Wesley
Professional, 1994), colloquially referred to as <em>The Gang of Four</em> book, is a
catalog of object-oriented design patterns. It defines OOP this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An <em>object</em> packages both
data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are
typically called <em>methods</em> or <em>operations</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this definition, Rust is object-oriented: structs and enums have data,
and <code>impl</code> blocks provide methods on structs and enums. Even though structs and
enums with methods aren’t <em>called</em> objects, they provide the same
functionality, according to the Gang of Four’s definition of objects.</p>
<h3 id="encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details"><a class="header" href="#encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details">Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details</a></h3>
<p>Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of <em>encapsulation</em>,
which means that the implementation details of an object aren’t accessible to
code using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is
through its public API; code using the object shouldn’t be able to reach into
the object’s internals and change data or behavior directly. This enables the
programmer to change and refactor an object’s internals without needing to
change the code that uses the object.</p>
<p>We discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: we can use the <code>pub</code>
keyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in our code
should be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we
can define a struct <code>AveragedCollection</code> that has a field containing a vector
of <code>i32</code> values. The struct can also have a field that contains the average of
the values in the vector, meaning the average doesn’t have to be computed
on demand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, <code>AveragedCollection</code> will
cache the calculated average for us. Listing 17-1 has the definition of the
<code>AveragedCollection</code> struct:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec&lt;i32&gt;,
    average: f64,
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-1: An <code>AveragedCollection</code> struct that
maintains a list of integers and the average of the items in the
collection</span></p>
<p>The struct is marked <code>pub</code> so that other code can use it, but the fields within
the struct remain private. This is important in this case because we want to
ensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the average is
also updated. We do this by implementing <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> methods
on the struct, as shown in Listing 17-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">pub struct AveragedCollection {
</span><span class="boring">    list: Vec&lt;i32&gt;,
</span><span class="boring">    average: f64,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn add(&amp;mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }

    pub fn remove(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) =&gt; {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            }
            None =&gt; None,
        }
    }

    pub fn average(&amp;self) -&gt; f64 {
        self.average
    }

    fn update_average(&amp;mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-2: Implementations of the public methods
<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> on <code>AveragedCollection</code></span></p>
<p>The public methods <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> are the only ways to access
or modify data in an instance of <code>AveragedCollection</code>. When an item is added
to <code>list</code> using the <code>add</code> method or removed using the <code>remove</code> method, the
implementations of each call the private <code>update_average</code> method that handles
updating the <code>average</code> field as well.</p>
<p>We leave the <code>list</code> and <code>average</code> fields private so there is no way for
external code to add or remove items to or from the <code>list</code> field directly;
otherwise, the <code>average</code> field might become out of sync when the <code>list</code>
changes. The <code>average</code> method returns the value in the <code>average</code> field,
allowing external code to read the <code>average</code> but not modify it.</p>
<p>Because we’ve encapsulated the implementation details of the struct
<code>AveragedCollection</code>, we can easily change aspects, such as the data structure,
in the future. For instance, we could use a <code>HashSet&lt;i32&gt;</code> instead of a
<code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> for the <code>list</code> field. As long as the signatures of the <code>add</code>,
<code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> public methods stay the same, code using
<code>AveragedCollection</code> wouldn’t need to change. If we made <code>list</code> public instead,
this wouldn’t necessarily be the case: <code>HashSet&lt;i32&gt;</code> and <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> have
different methods for adding and removing items, so the external code would
likely have to change if it were modifying <code>list</code> directly.</p>
<p>If encapsulation is a required aspect for a language to be considered
object-oriented, then Rust meets that requirement. The option to use <code>pub</code> or
not for different parts of code enables encapsulation of implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="inheritance-as-a-type-system-and-as-code-sharing"><a class="header" href="#inheritance-as-a-type-system-and-as-code-sharing">Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing</a></h3>
<p><em>Inheritance</em> is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from
another object’s definition, thus gaining the parent object’s data and behavior
without you having to define them again.</p>
<p>If a language must have inheritance to be an object-oriented language, then
Rust is not one. There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent
struct’s fields and method implementations without using a macro.</p>
<p>However, if you’re used to having inheritance in your programming toolbox, you
can use other solutions in Rust, depending on your reason for reaching for
inheritance in the first place.</p>
<p>You would choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code:
you can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables you
to reuse that implementation for a different type. You can do this in a limited
way in Rust code using default trait method implementations, which you saw in
Listing 10-14 when we added a default implementation of the <code>summarize</code> method
on the <code>Summary</code> trait. Any type implementing the <code>Summary</code> trait would have
the <code>summarize</code> method available on it without any further code. This is
similar to a parent class having an implementation of a method and an
inheriting child class also having the implementation of the method. We can
also override the default implementation of the <code>summarize</code> method when we
implement the <code>Summary</code> trait, which is similar to a child class overriding the
implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.</p>
<p>The other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to enable a
child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also
called <em>polymorphism</em>, which means that you can substitute multiple objects for
each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="polymorphism"><a class="header" href="#polymorphism">Polymorphism</a></h3>
<p>To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it’s
actually a more general concept that refers to code that can work with data
of multiple types. For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses.</p>
<p>Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and
trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is
sometimes called <em>bounded parametric polymorphism</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inheritance has recently fallen out of favor as a programming design solution
in many programming languages because it’s often at risk of sharing more code
than necessary. Subclasses shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their
parent class but will do so with inheritance. This can make a program’s design
less flexible. It also introduces the possibility of calling methods on
subclasses that don’t make sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t
apply to the subclass. In addition, some languages will only allow single
inheritance (meaning a subclass can only inherit from one class), further
restricting the flexibility of a program’s design.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust takes the different approach of using trait objects
instead of inheritance. Let’s look at how trait objects enable polymorphism in
Rust.</p>

<p>In Chapter 8, we mentioned that <strong>one limitation of vectors</strong> is that they can
store elements of only one type:</p>
<ol>
<li>We created a workaround in Listing 8-9 where
we defined a <code>SpreadsheetCell</code> enum that had variants to hold integers, floats,
and text.</li>
<li>This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and
still have a vector that represented a row of cells.</li>
<li>This is a perfectly good solution when our interchangeable items are <strong>a fixed set of types</strong> that we know
when our code is compiled.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>However, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the set of
types that are valid in a particular situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-we-achieve-to-extend-the-set-of-types"><a class="header" href="#how-we-achieve-to-extend-the-set-of-types">How we achieve to extend the set of types</a></h2>
<p>To show how we might achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’ll create an example graphical user interface (GUI) tool that iterates
through a list of items, calling a <code>draw</code> method on each one to draw it to the
screen—a common technique for GUI tools.</li>
<li>We’ll create a library crate called <code>gui</code> that contains the structure of a GUI library.</li>
<li>This crate might include some types for people to use, such as <code>Button</code> or <code>TextField</code>.</li>
<li>In addition, <code>gui</code> users will want to create their own types that can be drawn:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>for instance, one programmer might add an <code>Image</code> and another might add a
<code>SelectBox</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We won’t implement a fully fledged GUI library for this example but will show
how the pieces would fit together.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing the library, we can’t
know and define all the types other programmers might want to create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we do know that <code>gui</code> needs to keep track of many values of different types, and it
needs to call a <code>draw</code> method on each of these differently typed values. It
doesn’t need to know exactly what will happen when we call the <code>draw</code> method,
just that the value will have that method available for us to call.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-a-language-with-inheritance-do"><a class="header" href="#how-a-language-with-inheritance-do">How a language with inheritance do</a></h2>
<p>To do this in a language with inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>we might define a class named <code>Component</code> that has a method named <code>draw</code> on it.</li>
<li>The other classes, such as <code>Button</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>SelectBox</code>, would inherit from <code>Component</code> and thus
inherit the <code>draw</code> method.</li>
<li>They could each override the <code>draw</code> method to define their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if
they were <code>Component</code> instances and call <code>draw</code> on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>But because Rust
doesn’t have inheritance, we need another way to structure the <code>gui</code> library to
allow users to extend it with new types.</p>

<p>To implement the behavior we want <code>gui</code> to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’ll define a trait named
<code>Draw</code> that will have one method named <code>draw</code>.</li>
<li>Then we can define a vector that takes a <em>trait object</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A trait object points to both an instance of a type
implementing our specified trait and a table used to look up trait methods on
that type at runtime:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We create a trait object by <strong>specifying some sort of pointer</strong>, such as a <code>&amp;</code> reference or a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> smart pointer</li>
<li>then the <code>dyn</code>
keyword, and then specifying the relevant trait. (We’ll talk about the reason
trait objects must use a pointer in Chapter 19 in the section <a href="ch19-04-advanced-types.html#dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait">“Dynamically
Sized Types and the <code>Sized</code> Trait.”</a><!-- ignore -->)</li>
<li>We can use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherever we use a trait object, Rust’s type system will ensure at compile time that any value
used in that context will implement the trait object’s trait. Consequently, we
don’t need to know all the possible types at compile time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve mentioned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in Rust, we refrain from calling structs and enums
“objects” to distinguish them from other languages’ objects.</li>
<li>In a struct or
enum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in <code>impl</code> blocks are
separated, whereas in other languages, the data and behavior combined into one
concept is often labeled an object.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, trait objects <em>are</em> more like objects in other languages in the sense that they combine data and behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But trait objects differ from traditional objects in that we can’t add data to
a trait object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trait objects aren’t as generally useful as objects in other
languages: their specific purpose is to allow abstraction across common
behavior.</p>

<p>This concept—of being concerned only with the messages a value responds to

<ul>
<li>if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!</li>
<li>In the implementation of <code>run</code> on <code>Screen</code>
in Listing 17-5, <code>run</code> doesn’t need to know what the concrete type of each
component is.</li>
<li>It doesn’t check whether a component is an instance of a <code>Button</code>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By specifying <code>Box&lt;dyn Draw&gt;</code> as the type of the values in the <code>components</code>

<p>Recall in the <a href="ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics">“Performance of Code Using
Generics”</a><!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 10 our discussion on the <strong>monomorphization process</strong> performed by the
compiler when we use trait bounds on generics:</p>
<ol>
<li>the compiler generates nongeneric implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type that
we use in place of a generic type parameter.</li>
<li>The code that results from
monomorphization is doing <em>static dispatch</em>, which is when the compiler knows
what method you’re calling at compile time.</li>
<li>This is opposed to <em>dynamic
dispatch</em>, which is when the compiler can’t tell at compile time which method
you’re calling.</li>
<li>In dynamic dispatch cases, the compiler emits code that at
runtime will figure out which method to call.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The compiler doesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code that’s using trait objects,
so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call.</li>
<li>Instead, at
runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to
call.</li>
<li>This lookup incurs a runtime cost that doesn’t occur with static
dispatch.</li>
<li>Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a
method’s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations.</li>

<p>However, we did get extra flexibility in the code that we wrote in Listing 17-5 and were able to
support in Listing 17-9, so it’s a trade-off to consider.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="implementing-an-object-oriented-design-pattern"><a class="header" href="#implementing-an-object-oriented-design-pattern">Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern</a></h2>
<p>The <em>state pattern</em> is an object-oriented design pattern. The crux of the
pattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally. The
states are represented by a set of <em>state objects</em>, and the value’s behavior
changes based on its state. We’re going to work through an example of a blog
post struct that has a field to hold its state, which will be a state object
from the set “draft”, “review”, or “published”.</p>
<p>The state objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use structs and
traits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible
for its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another
state. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the different
behavior of the states or when to transition between states.</p>
<p>The advantage of using the state pattern is that, when the business
requirements of the program change, we won’t need to change the code of the
value holding the state or the code that uses the value. We’ll only need to
update the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps
add more state objects.</p>
<p>First, we’re going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional
object-oriented way, then we’ll use an approach that’s a bit more natural in
Rust. Let’s dig in to incrementally implementing a blog post workflow using the
state pattern.</p>
<p>The final functionality will look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A blog post starts as an empty draft.</li>
<li>When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.</li>
<li>When the post is approved, it gets published.</li>
<li>Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can’t
accidentally be published.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For example, if we
try to approve a draft blog post before we’ve requested a review, the post
should remain an unpublished draft.</p>
<p>Listing 17-11 shows this workflow in code form: this is an example usage of the
API we’ll implement in a library crate named <code>blog</code>. This won’t compile yet
because we haven’t implemented the <code>blog</code> crate.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());

    post.request_review();
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());

    post.approve();
    assert_eq!(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;, post.content());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-11: Code that demonstrates the desired
behavior we want our <code>blog</code> crate to have</span></p>
<p>We want to allow the user to create a new draft blog post with <code>Post::new</code>. We
want to allow text to be added to the blog post. If we try to get the post’s
content immediately, before approval, we shouldn’t get any text because the
post is still a draft. We’ve added <code>assert_eq!</code> in the code for demonstration
purposes. An excellent unit test for this would be to assert that a draft blog
post returns an empty string from the <code>content</code> method, but we’re not going to
write tests for this example.</p>
<p>Next, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want
<code>content</code> to return an empty string while waiting for the review. When the post
receives approval, it should get published, meaning the text of the post will
be returned when <code>content</code> is called.</p>
<p>Notice that the only type we’re interacting with from the crate is the <code>Post</code>
type. This type will use the state pattern and will hold a value that will be
one of three state objects representing the various states a post can be
in—draft, waiting for review, or published. Changing from one state to another
will be managed internally within the <code>Post</code> type. The states change in
response to the methods called by our library’s users on the <code>Post</code> instance,
but they don’t have to manage the state changes directly. Also, users can’t
make a mistake with the states, like publishing a post before it’s reviewed.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation of the library! We know we need a
public <code>Post</code> struct that holds some content, so we’ll start with the
definition of the struct and an associated public <code>new</code> function to create an
instance of <code>Post</code>, as shown in Listing 17-12. We’ll also make a private
<code>State</code> trait that will define the behavior that all state objects for a <code>Post</code>
must have.</p>
<p>Then <code>Post</code> will hold a trait object of <code>Box&lt;dyn State&gt;</code> inside an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
in a private field named <code>state</code> to hold the state object. You’ll see why the
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is necessary in a bit.</p>

function that creates a new <code>Post</code> instance, a <code>State</code> trait, and a <code>Draft</code>
struct</span></p>
<p>The <code>State</code> trait defines the behavior shared by different post states. The
state objects are <code>Draft</code>, <code>PendingReview</code>, and <code>Published</code>, and they will all
implement the <code>State</code> trait. For now, the trait doesn’t have any methods, and
we’ll start by defining just the <code>Draft</code> state because that is the state we
want a post to start in.</p>
<p>When we create a new <code>Post</code>, we set its <code>state</code> field to a <code>Some</code> value that
holds a <code>Box</code>. This <code>Box</code> points to a new instance of the <code>Draft</code> struct.
This ensures whenever we create a new instance of <code>Post</code>, it will start out as
a draft. Because the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code> is private, there is no way to
create a <code>Post</code> in any other state! In the <code>Post::new</code> function, we set the
<code>content</code> field to a new, empty <code>String</code>.</p>
<h3 id="storing-the-text-of-the-post-content"><a class="header" href="#storing-the-text-of-the-post-content">Storing the Text of the Post Content</a></h3>
<p>We saw in Listing 17-11 that we want to be able to call a method named
<code>add_text</code> and pass it a <code>&amp;str</code> that is then added as the text content of the
blog post. We implement this as a method, rather than exposing the <code>content</code>
field as <code>pub</code>, so that later we can implement a method that will control how
the <code>content</code> field’s data is read. The <code>add_text</code> method is pretty
straightforward, so let’s add the implementation in Listing 17-13 to the <code>impl Post</code> block:</p>

<p>The <code>add_text</code> method takes a mutable reference to <code>self</code>, because we’re
changing the <code>Post</code> instance that we’re calling <code>add_text</code> on. We then call
<code>push_str</code> on the <code>String</code> in <code>content</code> and pass the <code>text</code> argument to add to
the saved <code>content</code>. This behavior doesn’t depend on the state the post is in,
so it’s not part of the state pattern. The <code>add_text</code> method doesn’t interact
with the <code>state</code> field at all, but it is part of the behavior we want to
support.</p>

<p>Even after we’ve called <code>add_text</code> and added some content to our post, we still

implement the <code>content</code> method with the simplest thing that will fulfill this
requirement: always returning an empty string slice. We’ll change this later
once we implement the ability to change a post’s state so it can be published.
So far, posts can only be in the draft state, so the post content should always
be empty. Listing 17-14 shows this placeholder implementation:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-15: Implementing <code>request_review</code> methods on
<code>Post</code> and the <code>State</code> trait</span></p>
<p>We give <code>Post</code> a public method named <code>request_review</code> that will take a mutable
reference to <code>self</code>. Then we call an internal <code>request_review</code> method on the
current state of <code>Post</code>, and this second <code>request_review</code> method consumes the
current state and returns a new state.</p>
<p>We add the <code>request_review</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait; all types that
implement the trait will now need to implement the <code>request_review</code> method.
Note that rather than having <code>self</code>, <code>&amp;self</code>, or <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first
parameter of the method, we have <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>. This syntax means the
method is only valid when called on a <code>Box</code> holding the type. This syntax takes
ownership of <code>Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>, invalidating the old state so the state value of the
<code>Post</code> can transform into a new state.</p>
<p>To consume the old state, the <code>request_review</code> method needs to take ownership
of the state value. This is where the <code>Option</code> in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code>
comes in: we call the <code>take</code> method to take the <code>Some</code> value out of the <code>state</code>
field and leave a <code>None</code> in its place, because Rust doesn’t let us have
unpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the <code>state</code> value out of
<code>Post</code> rather than borrowing it. Then we’ll set the post’s <code>state</code> value to the
result of this operation.</p>
<p>We need to set <code>state</code> to <code>None</code> temporarily rather than setting it directly
with code like <code>self.state = self.state.request_review();</code> to get ownership of
the <code>state</code> value. This ensures <code>Post</code> can’t use the old <code>state</code> value after
we’ve transformed it into a new state.</p>
<p>The <code>request_review</code> method on <code>Draft</code> returns a new, boxed instance of a new
<code>PendingReview</code> struct, which represents the state when a post is waiting for a
review. The <code>PendingReview</code> struct also implements the <code>request_review</code> method
but doesn’t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself, because when we
request a review on a post already in the <code>PendingReview</code> state, it should stay
in the <code>PendingReview</code> state.</p>
<p>Now we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: the
<code>request_review</code> method on <code>Post</code> is the same no matter its <code>state</code> value. Each
state is responsible for its own rules.</p>
<p>We’ll leave the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code> as is, returning an empty string
slice. We can now have a <code>Post</code> in the <code>PendingReview</code> state as well as in the
<code>Draft</code> state, but we want the same behavior in the <code>PendingReview</code> state.
Listing 17-11 now works up to line 10!</p>

<p>The <code>approve</code> method will be similar to the <code>request_review</code> method: it will
set <code>state</code> to the value that the current state says it should have when that
state is approved, as shown in Listing 17-16:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-16: Implementing the <code>approve</code> method on

<p>We add the <code>approve</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait and add a new struct that
implements <code>State</code>, the <code>Published</code> state.</p>
<p>Similar to the way <code>request_review</code> on <code>PendingReview</code> works, if we call the
<code>approve</code> method on a <code>Draft</code>, it will have no effect because <code>approve</code> will
return <code>self</code>. When we call <code>approve</code> on <code>PendingReview</code>, it returns a new,
boxed instance of the <code>Published</code> struct. The <code>Published</code> struct implements the
<code>State</code> trait, and for both the <code>request_review</code> method and the <code>approve</code>
method, it returns itself, because the post should stay in the <code>Published</code>
state in those cases.</p>
<p>Now we need to update the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code>. We want the value
returned from <code>content</code> to depend on the current state of the <code>Post</code>, so we’re
going to have the <code>Post</code> delegate to a <code>content</code> method defined on its <code>state</code>,

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-17: Updating the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code> to
delegate to a <code>content</code> method on <code>State</code></span></p>
<p>Because the goal is to keep all these rules inside the structs that implement
<code>State</code>, we call a <code>content</code> method on the value in <code>state</code> and pass the post
instance (that is, <code>self</code>) as an argument. Then we return the value that’s
returned from using the <code>content</code> method on the <code>state</code> value.</p>
<p>We call the <code>as_ref</code> method on the <code>Option</code> because we want a reference to the
value inside the <code>Option</code> rather than ownership of the value. Because <code>state</code>
is an <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;</code>, when we call <code>as_ref</code>, an <code>Option&lt;&amp;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;</code> is returned. If we didn’t call <code>as_ref</code>, we would get an error because
we can’t move <code>state</code> out of the borrowed <code>&amp;self</code> of the function parameter.</p>
<p>We then call the <code>unwrap</code> method, which we know will never panic, because we
know the methods on <code>Post</code> ensure that <code>state</code> will always contain a <code>Some</code>
value when those methods are done. This is one of the cases we talked about in
the <a href="ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler">“Cases In Which You Have More Information Than the
Compiler”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 9 when we
know that a <code>None</code> value is never possible, even though the compiler isn’t able
to understand that.</p>
<p>At this point, when we call <code>content</code> on the <code>&amp;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;</code>, deref coercion
will take effect on the <code>&amp;</code> and the <code>Box</code> so the <code>content</code> method will
ultimately be called on the type that implements the <code>State</code> trait. That means
we need to add <code>content</code> to the <code>State</code> trait definition, and that is where
we’ll put the logic for what content to return depending on which state we
have, as shown in Listing 17-18:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-18: Adding the <code>content</code> method to the <code>State</code>

<p>We add a default implementation for the <code>content</code> method that returns an empty
string slice. That means we don’t need to implement <code>content</code> on the <code>Draft</code>
and <code>PendingReview</code> structs. The <code>Published</code> struct will override the <code>content</code>
method and return the value in <code>post.content</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we need lifetime annotations on this method, as we discussed in
Chapter 10. We’re taking a reference to a <code>post</code> as an argument and returning a
reference to part of that <code>post</code>, so the lifetime of the returned reference is
related to the lifetime of the <code>post</code> argument.</p>
<p>And we’re done—all of Listing 17-11 now works! We’ve implemented the state
pattern with the rules of the blog post workflow. The logic related to the
rules lives in the state objects rather than being scattered throughout <code>Post</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="why-not-an-enum"><a class="header" href="#why-not-an-enum">Why Not An Enum?</a></h4>
<p>You may have been wondering why we didn’t use an <code>enum</code> with the different
possible post states as variants. That’s certainly a possible solution, try
it and compare the end results to see which you prefer! One disadvantage of
using an enum is every place that checks the value of the enum will need a
<code>match</code> expression or similar to handle every possible variant. This could
get more repetitive than this trait object solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trade-offs-of-the-state-pattern"><a class="header" href="#trade-offs-of-the-state-pattern">Trade-offs of the State Pattern</a></h3>
<p>We’ve shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented state
pattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in
each state. The methods on <code>Post</code> know nothing about the various behaviors. The
way we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to know the
different ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the <code>State</code>
trait on the <code>Published</code> struct.</p>
<p>If we were to create an alternative implementation that didn’t use the state
pattern, we might instead use <code>match</code> expressions in the methods on <code>Post</code> or
even in the <code>main</code> code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior
in those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to
understand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This
would only increase the more states we added: each of those <code>match</code> expressions
would need another arm.</p>
<p>With the state pattern, the <code>Post</code> methods and the places we use <code>Post</code> don’t
need <code>match</code> expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a
new struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct.</p>
<p>The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more
functionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state
pattern, try a few of these suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>reject</code> method that changes the post’s state from <code>PendingReview</code> back
to <code>Draft</code>.</li>
<li>Require two calls to <code>approve</code> before the state can be changed to <code>Published</code>.</li>
<li>Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the <code>Draft</code> state.
Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the
content but not responsible for modifying the <code>Post</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement the
transitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we
add another state between <code>PendingReview</code> and <code>Published</code>, such as <code>Scheduled</code>,
we would have to change the code in <code>PendingReview</code> to transition to
<code>Scheduled</code> instead. It would be less work if <code>PendingReview</code> didn’t need to
change with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to
another design pattern.</p>
<p>Another downside is that we’ve duplicated some logic. To eliminate some of the
duplication, we might try to make default implementations for the
<code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods on the <code>State</code> trait that return <code>self</code>;
however, this would violate object safety, because the trait doesn’t know what
the concrete <code>self</code> will be exactly. We want to be able to use <code>State</code> as a
trait object, so we need its methods to be object safe.</p>
<p>Other duplication includes the similar implementations of the <code>request_review</code>
and <code>approve</code> methods on <code>Post</code>. Both methods delegate to the implementation of
the same method on the value in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Option</code> and set the new
value of the <code>state</code> field to the result. If we had a lot of methods on <code>Post</code>
that followed this pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the
repetition (see the <a href="ch19-06-macros.html#macros">“Macros”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 19).</p>
<p>By implementing the state pattern exactly as it’s defined for object-oriented
languages, we’re not taking as full advantage of Rust’s strengths as we could.
Let’s look at some changes we can make to the <code>blog</code> crate that can make
invalid states and transitions into compile time errors.</p>
<h4 id="encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types"><a class="header" href="#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types">Encoding States and Behavior as Types</a></h4>
<p>We’ll show you how to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of
trade-offs. Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so
outside code has no knowledge of them, we’ll encode the states into different
types. Consequently, Rust’s type checking system will prevent attempts to use
draft posts where only published posts are allowed by issuing a compiler error.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the first part of <code>main</code> in Listing 17-11:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use blog::Post;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    post.request_review();
</span><span class="boring">    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    post.approve();
</span><span class="boring">    assert_eq!(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;, post.content());
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>We still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using <code>Post::new</code>
and the ability to add text to the post’s content. But instead of having a
<code>content</code> method on a draft post that returns an empty string, we’ll make it so
draft posts don’t have the <code>content</code> method at all. That way, if we try to get
a draft post’s content, we’ll get a compiler error telling us the method
doesn’t exist. As a result, it will be impossible for us to accidentally
display draft post content in production, because that code won’t even compile.
Listing 17-19 shows the definition of a <code>Post</code> struct and a <code>DraftPost</code> struct,
as well as methods on each:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub struct Post {
    content: String,
}

pub struct DraftPost {
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -&gt; DraftPost {
        DraftPost {
            content: String::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn content(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
        &amp;self.content
    }
}

impl DraftPost {
    pub fn add_text(&amp;mut self, text: &amp;str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-19: A <code>Post</code> with a <code>content</code> method and a
<code>DraftPost</code> without a <code>content</code> method</span></p>
<p>Both the <code>Post</code> and <code>DraftPost</code> structs have a private <code>content</code> field that
stores the blog post text. The structs no longer have the <code>state</code> field because
we’re moving the encoding of the state to the types of the structs. The <code>Post</code>
struct will represent a published post, and it has a <code>content</code> method that
returns the <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>We still have a <code>Post::new</code> function, but instead of returning an instance of
<code>Post</code>, it returns an instance of <code>DraftPost</code>. Because <code>content</code> is private
and there aren’t any functions that return <code>Post</code>, it’s not possible to create
an instance of <code>Post</code> right now.</p>
<p>The <code>DraftPost</code> struct has an <code>add_text</code> method, so we can add text to
<code>content</code> as before, but note that <code>DraftPost</code> does not have a <code>content</code> method
defined! So now the program ensures all posts start as draft posts, and draft
posts don’t have their content available for display. Any attempt to get around
these constraints will result in a compiler error.</p>
<h4 id="implementing-transitions-as-transformations-into-different-types"><a class="header" href="#implementing-transitions-as-transformations-into-different-types">Implementing Transitions as Transformations into Different Types</a></h4>
<p>So how do we get a published post? We want to enforce the rule that a draft
post has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published. A post in the
pending review state should still not display any content. Let’s implement
these constraints by adding another struct, <code>PendingReviewPost</code>, defining the
<code>request_review</code> method on <code>DraftPost</code> to return a <code>PendingReviewPost</code>, and
defining an <code>approve</code> method on <code>PendingReviewPost</code> to return a <code>Post</code>, as
shown in Listing 17-20:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-20: A <code>PendingReviewPost</code> that gets created by
calling <code>request_review</code> on <code>DraftPost</code> and an <code>approve</code> method that turns a
<code>PendingReviewPost</code> into a published <code>Post</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods take ownership of <code>self</code>, thus
consuming the <code>DraftPost</code> and <code>PendingReviewPost</code> instances and transforming
them into a <code>PendingReviewPost</code> and a published <code>Post</code>, respectively. This way,
we won’t have any lingering <code>DraftPost</code> instances after we’ve called
<code>request_review</code> on them, and so forth. The <code>PendingReviewPost</code> struct doesn’t
have a <code>content</code> method defined on it, so attempting to read its content
results in a compiler error, as with <code>DraftPost</code>. Because the only way to get a
published <code>Post</code> instance that does have a <code>content</code> method defined is to call
the <code>approve</code> method on a <code>PendingReviewPost</code>, and the only way to get a
<code>PendingReviewPost</code> is to call the <code>request_review</code> method on a <code>DraftPost</code>,
we’ve now encoded the blog post workflow into the type system.</p>
<p>But we also have to make some small changes to <code>main</code>. The <code>request_review</code> and
<code>approve</code> methods return new instances rather than modifying the struct they’re
called on, so we need to add more <code>let post =</code> shadowing assignments to save
the returned instances. We also can’t have the assertions about the draft and
pending review posts’ contents be empty strings, nor do we need them: we can’t
compile code that tries to use the content of posts in those states any longer.
The updated code in <code>main</code> is shown in Listing 17-21:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);

    let post = post.request_review();

    let post = post.approve();

    assert_eq!(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;, post.content());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-21: Modifications to <code>main</code> to use the new
implementation of the blog post workflow</span></p>
<p>The changes we needed to make to <code>main</code> to reassign <code>post</code> mean that this
implementation doesn’t quite follow the object-oriented state pattern anymore:
the transformations between the states are no longer encapsulated entirely
within the <code>Post</code> implementation. However, our gain is that invalid states are
now impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens at
compile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as display of the content of
an unpublished post, will be discovered before they make it to production.</p>
<p>Try the tasks suggested at the start of this section on the <code>blog</code> crate as it
is after Listing 17-21 to see what you think about the design of this version
of the code. Note that some of the tasks might be completed already in this
design.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that even though Rust is capable of implementing object-oriented
design patterns, other patterns, such as encoding state into the type system,
are also available in Rust. These patterns have different trade-offs. Although
you might be very familiar with object-oriented patterns, rethinking the
problem to take advantage of Rust’s features can provide benefits, such as
preventing some bugs at compile time. Object-oriented patterns won’t always be
the best solution in Rust due to certain features, like ownership, that
object-oriented languages don’t have.</p>
<h2 id="summary-17"><a class="header" href="#summary-17">Summary</a></h2>
<p>No matter whether or not you think Rust is an object-oriented language after
reading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects to get some
object-oriented features in Rust. Dynamic dispatch can give your code some
flexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. You can use this
flexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code’s
maintainability. Rust also has other features, like ownership, that
object-oriented languages don’t have. An object-oriented pattern won’t always
be the best way to take advantage of Rust’s strengths, but is an available
option.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at patterns, which are another of Rust’s features that enable
lots of flexibility. We’ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but
haven’t seen their full capability yet. Let’s go!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="patterns-and-matching"><a class="header" href="#patterns-and-matching">Patterns and Matching</a></h1>
<p><em>Patterns</em> are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of
types, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with <code>match</code>
expressions and other constructs gives you more control over a program’s
control flow. A pattern consists of some combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literals</li>
<li>Destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Wildcards</li>
<li>Placeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>Some example patterns include <code>x</code>, <code>(a, 3)</code>, and <code>Some(Color::Red)</code>. In the
contexts in which patterns are valid, these components describe the shape of
data. Our program then matches values against the patterns to determine whether
it has the correct shape of data to continue running a particular piece of code.</p>
<p>To use a pattern, we compare it to some value. If the pattern matches the
value, we use the value parts in our code. Recall the <code>match</code> expressions in
Chapter 6 that used patterns, such as the coin-sorting machine example. If the
value fits the shape of the pattern, we can use the named pieces. If it
doesn’t, the code associated with the pattern won’t run.</p>
<p>This chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns. We’ll cover the
valid places to use patterns, the difference between refutable and irrefutable
patterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that you might see. By the
end of the chapter, you’ll know how to use patterns to express many concepts in
a clear way.</p>

<p>Patterns pop up in a number of places in Rust, and you’ve been using them a lot
without realizing it! This section discusses all the places where patterns are
valid.</p>
<h2 id="match-arms"><a class="header" href="#match-arms"><code>match</code> Arms</a></h2>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of <code>match</code> expressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formally, <code>match</code> expressions are defined as the keyword <code>match</code>, a value to
match on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an
expression to run if the value matches that arm’s pattern, like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-text">match VALUE {
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
}
</code></pre>
<p>For example, here’s the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 6-5 that matches on an
<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> value in the variable <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">match x {
    None =&gt; None,
    Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
}
</code></pre>
<p>The patterns in this <code>match</code> expression are the <code>None</code> and <code>Some(i)</code> on the
left of each arrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One requirement for <code>match</code> expressions is that they need to be <em>exhaustive</em> in
the sense that all possibilities for the value in the <code>match</code> expression must
be accounted for. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to ensure you’ve covered every possibility is to have
a catchall pattern for the last arm: for example, a variable name matching any
value can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The particular pattern <code>_</code> will match anything, but it never binds to a
variable, so it’s often used in the last match arm. </li>
<li>The <code>_</code> pattern can be
useful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We’ll
cover the <code>_</code> pattern in more detail in the <a href="ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-values-in-a-pattern">“Ignoring Values in a
Pattern”</a><!-- ignore --> section later in this
chapter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conditional-if-let-expressions"><a class="header" href="#conditional-if-let-expressions">Conditional <code>if let</code> Expressions</a></h2>
<p>In Chapter 6 we discussed how to use <code>if let</code> expressions mainly as a shorter
way to write the equivalent of a <code>match</code> that only matches one case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optionally, <code>if let</code> can have a corresponding <code>else</code> containing code to run if
the pattern in the <code>if let</code> doesn’t match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listing 18-1 shows that it’s also possible to mix and match <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else if let</code> expressions. </p>
<p>Doing so gives us more flexibility than a
<code>match</code> expression in which we can express only one value to compare with the
patterns. Also, Rust doesn’t require that the conditions in a series of <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else if let</code> arms relate to each other.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 18-1 determines what color to make your background based on
a series of checks for several conditions. For this example, we’ve created
variables with hardcoded values that a real program might receive from user
input.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">fn main() {
    let favorite_color: Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; = None;
    let is_tuesday = false;
    let age: Result&lt;u8, _&gt; = &quot;34&quot;.parse();

    if let Some(color) = favorite_color {
        println!(&quot;Using your favorite color, {color}, as the background&quot;);
    } else if is_tuesday {
        println!(&quot;Tuesday is green day!&quot;);
    } else if let Ok(age) = age {
        if age &gt; 30 {
            println!(&quot;Using purple as the background color&quot;);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;Using orange as the background color&quot;);
        }
    } else {
        println!(&quot;Using blue as the background color&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-1: Mixing <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else if let</code>,
and <code>else</code></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If the user specifies a favorite color, that color is used as the background. </li>
<li>If no favorite color is specified and today is Tuesday, the background color is
green. </li>
<li>Otherwise, if the user specifies their age as a string and we can parse
it as a number successfully, the color is either purple or orange depending on
the value of the number. </li>
<li>If none of these conditions apply, the background
color is blue. </li>
<li>This conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. </li>
<li>With the
hardcoded values we have here, this example will print <code>Using purple as the background color</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see that <code>if let</code> can also introduce shadowed variables in the same way
that <code>match</code> arms can: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the line <code>if let Ok(age) = age</code> introduces a new
shadowed <code>age</code> variable that contains the value inside the <code>Ok</code> variant.</li>
<li>This
means we need to place the <code>if age &gt; 30</code> condition within that block: we can’t
combine these two conditions into <code>if let Ok(age) = age &amp;&amp; age &gt; 30</code>.</li>
<li>The
shadowed <code>age</code> we want to compare to 30 isn’t valid until the new scope starts
with the curly bracket.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The downside of using <code>if let</code> expressions is that the compiler doesn’t check
for exhaustiveness, whereas with <code>match</code> expressions it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we omitted the
last <code>else</code> block and therefore missed handling some cases, the compiler would
not alert us to the possible logic bug.</p>
<h2 id="while-let-conditional-loops"><a class="header" href="#while-let-conditional-loops"><code>while let</code> Conditional Loops</a></h2>
<p>Similar in construction to <code>if let</code>, the <code>while let</code> conditional loop allows a
<code>while</code> loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to match.</p>
<p>In Listing
18-2 we code a <code>while let</code> loop that uses a vector as a stack and prints the
values in the vector in the opposite order in which they were pushed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut stack = Vec::new();

    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);

    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, top);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-2: Using a <code>while let</code> loop to print values
for as long as <code>stack.pop()</code> returns <code>Some</code></span></p>
<ul>
<li>This example prints 3, 2, and then 1. </li>
<li>The <code>pop</code> method takes the last element out of the vector and returns <code>Some(value)</code>.</li>
<li>If the vector is empty, <code>pop</code> returns <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>while</code> loop continues running the code in its block as long as <code>pop</code> returns <code>Some</code>. When <code>pop</code> returns <code>None</code>, the loop stops. </li>
<li>We can use <code>while let</code> to pop every element off our stack.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="for-loops"><a class="header" href="#for-loops"><code>for</code> Loops</a></h2>
<p>In a <code>for</code> loop, the value that directly follows the keyword <code>for</code> is a
pattern. For example, in <code>for x in y</code> the <code>x</code> is the pattern. </p>
<p>Listing 18-3
demonstrates how to use a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to destructure, or break
apart, a tuple as part of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];

    for (index, value) in v.iter().enumerate() {
        println!(&quot;{} is at index {}&quot;, value, index);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-3: Using a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to

<p>The code in Listing 18-3 will print the following:</p>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We adapt an iterator using the <code>enumerate</code> method so it produces a value and
the index for that value, placed into a tuple. </li>
<li>The first value produced is the tuple <code>(0, 'a')</code>. </li>
<li>When this value is matched to the pattern <code>(index, value)</code>,
<code>index</code> will be <code>0</code> and <code>value</code> will be <code>'a'</code>, printing the first line of the
output.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="let-statements"><a class="header" href="#let-statements"><code>let</code> Statements</a></h2>
<p>Prior to this chapter, we had only explicitly discussed using patterns with
<code>match</code> and <code>if let</code>, but in fact, we’ve used patterns in other places as well,
including in <code>let</code> statements. </p>
<p>For example, consider this straightforward variable assignment with <code>let</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let x = 5;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Every time you’ve used a <code>let</code> statement like this you’ve been using patterns,
although you might not have realized it! More formally, a <code>let</code> statement looks
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">let PATTERN = EXPRESSION;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In statements like <code>let x = 5;</code> with a variable name in the <code>PATTERN</code> slot, the
variable name is just a particularly simple form of a pattern. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rust compares the expression against the pattern and assigns any names it finds. </li>
<li>So in the
<code>let x = 5;</code> example, <code>x</code> is a pattern that means “bind what matches here to
the variable <code>x</code>.” </li>
<li>Because the name <code>x</code> is the whole pattern, this pattern
effectively means “bind everything to the variable <code>x</code>, whatever the value is.”</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the pattern matching aspect of <code>let</code> more clearly, consider Listing
18-4, which uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to destructure a tuple.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);

</blockquote>
<p>At this point, you’ve seen several ways of using patterns, but patterns don’t
work the same in every place we can use them. In some places, the patterns must
be irrefutable; in other circumstances, they can be refutable. We’ll discuss
these two concepts next.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="refutability-whether-a-pattern-might-fail-to-match"><a class="header" href="#refutability-whether-a-pattern-might-fail-to-match">Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match</a></h2>
<p>Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will match
for any possible value passed are <em>irrefutable</em>. An example would be <code>x</code> in the
statement <code>let x = 5;</code> because <code>x</code> matches anything and therefore cannot fail
to match. Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are
<em>refutable</em>. An example would be <code>Some(x)</code> in the expression <code>if let Some(x) = a_value</code> because if the value in the <code>a_value</code> variable is <code>None</code> rather than
<code>Some</code>, the <code>Some(x)</code> pattern will not match.</p>
<p>Function parameters, <code>let</code> statements, and <code>for</code> loops can only accept
irrefutable patterns, because the program cannot do anything meaningful when
values don’t match. The <code>if let</code> and <code>while let</code> expressions accept
refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the compiler warns against
irrefutable patterns because by definition they’re intended to handle possible
failure: the functionality of a conditional is in its ability to perform
differently depending on success or failure.</p>
<p>In general, you shouldn’t have to worry about the distinction between refutable
and irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar with the concept
of refutability so you can respond when you see it in an error message. In
those cases, you’ll need to change either the pattern or the construct you’re
using the pattern with, depending on the intended behavior of the code.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example of what happens when we try to use a refutable pattern
where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. Listing 18-8 shows a
<code>let</code> statement, but for the pattern we’ve specified <code>Some(x)</code>, a refutable
pattern. As you might expect, this code will not compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let some_option_value: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-8: Attempting to use a refutable pattern with
<code>let</code></span></p>
<p>If <code>some_option_value</code> was a <code>None</code> value, it would fail to match the pattern
<code>Some(x)</code>, meaning the pattern is refutable. However, the <code>let</code> statement can
only accept an irrefutable pattern because there is nothing valid the code can
do with a <code>None</code> value. At compile time, Rust will complain that we’ve tried to
use a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is required:</p>

<p>Because we didn’t cover (and couldn’t cover!) every valid value with the
pattern <code>Some(x)</code>, Rust rightfully produces a compiler error.</p>
<p>If we have a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is needed, we can
fix it by changing the code that uses the pattern: instead of using <code>let</code>, we
can use <code>if let</code>. Then if the pattern doesn’t match, the code will just skip
the code in the curly brackets, giving it a way to continue validly. Listing
18-9 shows how to fix the code in Listing 18-8.</p>

<p>For this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for the last
arm, which should match any remaining values with an irrefutable pattern. Rust
allows us to use an irrefutable pattern in a <code>match</code> with only one arm, but
this syntax isn’t particularly useful and could be replaced with a simpler
<code>let</code> statement.</p>
<p>Now that you know where to use patterns and the difference between refutable
and irrefutable patterns, let’s cover all the syntax we can use to create
patterns.</p>

<li>Rust’s pattern matching syntax is similar to that of other programming languages like Scala and Haskell, but it has some unique features such as the ability to define custom patterns using the @ operator.</li>
<li>Some benefits of using pattern matching in Rust include its ability to make code more concise and readable, its ability to handle complex data types easily, and its ability to prevent runtime errors by ensuring that all possible cases are handled.</li>
<li>Some potential challenges associated with using pattern matching in Rust include the need to carefully consider all possible cases and the potential for complex code that is difficult to maintain.</li>
<li>To practice and experiment with pattern matching in Rust, you might start by writing simple programs that use basic patterns like literals and variables, and then gradually work your way up to more complex patterns like structs and enums. The Rust documentation and other online resources can also be helpful for learning more about pattern matching in Rust.</li>
<li>A real-world problem that you might solve using pattern matching in Rust could be parsing a file format that contains structured data. By using patterns to match against different parts of the file format, you could easily extract the data you need and transform it into a more useful format</li>

<p>Let’s walk through what happens when the <code>match</code> expression runs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pattern in the first match arm doesn’t match the defined value of <code>x</code>, so the code continues.</li>
<li>The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named <code>y</code> that will match any value inside a <code>Some</code>
value.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Because we’re in a new scope inside the <code>match</code> expression, this is a new <code>y</code> variable, not the <code>y</code> we declared at
the beginning with the value 10.</li>
<li>This new <code>y</code> binding will match any value inside a <code>Some</code>, which is what we have in <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>Therefore, this new <code>y</code> binds to the inner value of the <code>Some</code> in <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>That value is <code>5</code>, so the expression for that arm executes and prints <code>Matched, y = 5</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>If <code>x</code> had been a <code>None</code> value instead of <code>Some(5)</code>, the patterns in the first
two arms wouldn’t have matched, so the value would have matched to the
underscore.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We didn’t introduce the <code>x</code> variable in the pattern of the
underscore arm, so the <code>x</code> in the expression is still the outer <code>x</code> that hasn’t
been shadowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this hypothetical case, the <code>match</code> would print <code>Default case, x = None</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>When the <code>match</code> expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the scope of
the inner <code>y</code>. The last <code>println!</code> produces <code>at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10</code>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>To create a <code>match</code> expression that compares the values of the outer <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, rather than introducing a shadowed
variable, we would need to use a <strong>match guard conditional</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll talk about match guards later in the <a href="ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#extra-conditionals-with-match-guards">“Extra
Conditionals with Match Guards”</a><!--

<h2 id="extra-conditionals-with-match-guards"><a class="header" href="#extra-conditionals-with-match-guards">Extra Conditionals with Match Guards</a></h2>
<p>A <em>match guard</em> is an additional <code>if</code> condition, specified after the pattern in
a <code>match</code> arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The condition can use variables created in the pattern.</p>
<p>Listing 18-26 shows a <code>match</code> where the first arm has the pattern <code>Some(x)</code> and also has a match
guard of <code>if x % 2 == 0</code> (which will be true if the number is even).</p>

<p>This example will print <code>The number 4 is even</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When <code>num</code> is compared to the pattern in the first arm, it matches, because <code>Some(4)</code> matches <code>Some(x)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the match guard checks whether the remainder of dividing <code>x</code> by 2 is equal to
0, and because it is, the first arm is selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>num</code> had been <code>Some(5)</code> instead, the match guard in the first arm would
have been false because the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1, which is not
equal to 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust would then go to the second arm, which would match because the
second arm doesn’t have a match guard and therefore matches any <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no way to express the <code>if x % 2 == 0</code> condition within a pattern, so
the match guard gives us the ability to express this logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn’t try to check for
exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Listing 18-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to solve our
<strong>pattern-shadowing problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Recall that we created a new variable inside the
pattern in the <code>match</code> expression instead of using the variable outside the
<code>match</code>.</p>
<p>That new variable meant we couldn’t test against the value of the
outer variable.</p>
<p>Listing 18-27 shows how we can use a match guard to fix this problem.</p>

</details>
<p>This code will now print <code>Default case, x = Some(5)</code>.</p>
<p>The pattern in the second
match arm doesn’t introduce a new variable <code>y</code> that would shadow the outer <code>y</code>,
meaning we can use the outer <code>y</code> in the match guard.</p>
<p>Instead of specifying the pattern as <code>Some(y)</code>, which would have shadowed the outer <code>y</code>, we specify
<code>Some(n)</code>.</p>
<p>This creates a new variable <code>n</code> that doesn’t shadow anything because
there is no <code>n</code> variable outside the <code>match</code>.</p>
<p>The match guard <code>if n == y</code> is not a pattern and therefore doesn’t introduce
new variables.</p>
<p>This <code>y</code> <em>is</em> the outer <code>y</code> rather than a new shadowed <code>y</code>, and
we can look for a value that has the same value as the outer <code>y</code> by comparing
<code>n</code> to <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <em>or</em> operator <code>|</code> in a match guard to specify multiple
patterns;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the match guard condition will apply to all the patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listing
18-28 shows the precedence when combining a pattern that uses <code>|</code> with a match
guard.</p>
<p>The important part of this example is that the <code>if y</code> match guard
applies to <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, <em>and</em> <code>6</code>, even though it might look like <code>if y</code> only
applies to <code>6</code>.</p>

<p>The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of <code>x</code> is
equal to <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, or <code>6</code> <em>and</em> if <code>y</code> is <code>true</code>. When this code runs, the
pattern of the first arm matches because <code>x</code> is <code>4</code>, but the match guard <code>if y</code>
is false, so the first arm is not chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code moves on to the second arm,
which does match, and this program prints <code>no</code>. The reason is that the <code>if</code>
condition applies to the whole pattern <code>4 | 5 | 6</code>, not only to the last value
<code>6</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, the precedence of a match guard in relation to a pattern
behaves like this:</p>
</li>

</code></pre>
<p>rather than this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">4 | 5 | (6 if y) =&gt; ...
</code></pre>
<p>After running the code, the precedence behavior is evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the match guard
were applied only to the final value in the list of values specified using the
<code>|</code> operator, the arm would have matched and the program would have printed
<code>yes</code>.</li>

<p>Specifying a range is much shorter, especially if we want to match, say, any

<p>The compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time, and because the

<p>This code lets us break complex types into their component parts so we can use
the values we’re interested in separately.</p>
<p>Destructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values, such
as the value from each field in a struct, separately from each other.</p>
<h1 id="c-ignoring-values-in-a-pattern"><a class="header" href="#c-ignoring-values-in-a-pattern">C. Ignoring Values in a Pattern</a></h1>
<p>You’ve seen that it’s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as
in the last arm of a <code>match</code>, to get a catchall that doesn’t actually do
anything but does account for all remaining possible values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few ways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>using the <code>_</code> pattern (which you’ve seen)</li>
<li>using the <code>_</code> pattern within another pattern,</li>
<li>using a name that starts with an underscore,</li>
<li>or using <code>..</code> to ignore remaining parts of a value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.</p>
<h2 id="1-ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_"><a class="header" href="#1-ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_">1. Ignoring an Entire Value with <code>_</code></a></h2>
<p>We’ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but
not bind to the value.</p>
<p>This is especially useful as the last arm in a <code>match</code> expression, but we can also use it in any pattern, including
function
parameters, as shown in Listing 18-17.</p>

}
</code></pre></pre>
</div>
</details>
<p>This code will completely ignore the value <code>3</code> passed as the first argument,
and will print <code>This code only uses the y parameter: 4</code>.</p>
<p>In most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, you
would change the signature so it doesn’t include the unused parameter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring a function parameter can be especially useful in cases when, for example,
you’re implementing a trait when you need a certain type signature but the
function body in your implementation doesn’t need one of the parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You then avoid getting a compiler warning about unused function parameters, as you
would if you used a name instead.</p>

<p>We can also use <code>_</code> <strong>inside another pattern</strong> to ignore just part of a value, for
example, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the
other parts in the corresponding code we want to run.</p>
<p>Listing 18-18 shows code responsible for managing a setting’s value.</p>

the user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a

<p>Rust’s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of
data:</p>
<ul>
<li>When used in <code>match</code> expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every
possible value, or your program won’t compile.</li>
<li>Patterns in <code>let</code> statements and
function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the
destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to
variables.</li>
<li>We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, for the penultimate chapter of the book, we’ll look at some advanced
aspects of a variety of Rust’s features.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advanced-features"><a class="header" href="#advanced-features">Advanced Features</a></h1>
<p>By now, you’ve learned the most commonly used parts of the Rust programming
language. Before we do one more project in Chapter 20, we’ll look at a few
aspects of the language you might run into every once in a while, but may not
use every day. You can use this chapter as a reference for when you encounter
any unknowns. The features covered here are useful in very specific situations.
Although you might not reach for them often, we want to make sure you have a
grasp of all the features Rust has to offer.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsafe Rust: how to opt out of some of Rust’s guarantees and take
responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees</li>
<li>Advanced traits: associated types, default type parameters, fully qualified
syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits</li>
<li>Advanced types: more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the never type,
and dynamically sized types</li>
<li>Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning closures</li>
<li>Macros: ways to define code that defines more code at compile time</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a panoply of Rust features with something for everyone! Let’s dive in!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="unsafe-rust"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-rust">Unsafe Rust</a></h2>
<p>All the code we’ve discussed so far has had Rust’s memory safety guarantees
enforced at compile time. However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it
that doesn’t enforce these memory safety guarantees: it’s called <em>unsafe Rust</em>
and works just like regular Rust, but gives us extra superpowers.</p>
<p>Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. When
the compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees,
it’s better for it to reject some valid programs than to accept some invalid
programs. Although the code <em>might</em> be okay, if the Rust compiler doesn’t have
enough information to be confident, it will reject the code. In these cases,
you can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, “Trust me, I know what I’m
doing.” Be warned, however, that you use unsafe Rust at your own risk: if you
use unsafe code incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety, such as
null pointer dereferencing.</p>
<p>Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer
hardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn’t let you do unsafe operations, you
couldn’t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems
programming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even
writing your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming
is one of the goals of the language. Let’s explore what we can do with unsafe
Rust and how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="unsafe-superpowers"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-superpowers">Unsafe Superpowers</a></h3>
<p>To switch to unsafe Rust, use the <code>unsafe</code> keyword and then start a new block
that holds the unsafe code. You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you
can’t in safe Rust, which we call <em>unsafe superpowers</em>. Those superpowers
include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dereference a raw pointer</li>
<li>Call an unsafe function or method</li>
<li>Access or modify a mutable static variable</li>
<li>Implement an unsafe trait</li>
<li>Access fields of <code>union</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to understand that <code>unsafe</code> doesn’t turn off the borrow checker
or disable any other of Rust’s safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe
code, it will still be checked. The <code>unsafe</code> keyword only gives you access to
these five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory
safety. You’ll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>unsafe</code> does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily
dangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: the intent is
that as the programmer, you’ll ensure the code inside an <code>unsafe</code> block will
access memory in a valid way.</p>
<p>People are fallible, and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these five
unsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with <code>unsafe</code> you’ll know that
any errors related to memory safety must be within an <code>unsafe</code> block. Keep
<code>unsafe</code> blocks small; you’ll be thankful later when you investigate memory
bugs.</p>
<p>To isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it’s best to enclose unsafe code
within a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we’ll discuss later in
the chapter when we examine unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the standard
library are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has been
audited. Wrapping unsafe code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of <code>unsafe</code>
from leaking out into all the places that you or your users might want to use
the functionality implemented with <code>unsafe</code> code, because using a safe
abstraction is safe.</p>
<p>Let’s look at each of the five unsafe superpowers in turn. We’ll also look at
some abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.</p>
<h3 id="dereferencing-a-raw-pointer"><a class="header" href="#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer">Dereferencing a Raw Pointer</a></h3>
<p>In Chapter 4, in the <a href="ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#dangling-references">“Dangling References”</a><!-- ignore
--> section, we mentioned that the compiler ensures references are always
valid. Unsafe Rust has two new types called <em>raw pointers</em> that are similar to
references. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and
are written as <code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code>, respectively. The asterisk isn’t the
dereference operator; it’s part of the type name. In the context of raw
pointers, <em>immutable</em> means that the pointer can’t be directly assigned to
after being dereferenced.</p>
<p>Different from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and
mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location</li>
<li>Aren’t guaranteed to point to valid memory</li>
<li>Are allowed to be null</li>
<li>Don’t implement any automatic cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>By opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up
guaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to
interface with another language or hardware where Rust’s guarantees don’t apply.</p>
<p>Listing 19-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer from
references.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &amp;num as *const i32;
    let r2 = &amp;mut num as *mut i32;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-1: Creating raw pointers from references</span></p>
<p>Notice that we don’t include the <code>unsafe</code> keyword in this code. We can create
raw pointers in safe code; we just can’t dereference raw pointers outside an
unsafe block, as you’ll see in a bit.</p>
<p>We’ve created raw pointers by using <code>as</code> to cast an immutable and a mutable
reference into their corresponding raw pointer types. Because we created them
directly from references guaranteed to be valid, we know these particular raw
pointers are valid, but we can’t make that assumption about just any raw
pointer.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, next we’ll create a raw pointer whose validity we can’t be
so certain of. Listing 19-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary
location in memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: there might be
data at that address or there might not, the compiler might optimize the code
so there is no memory access, or the program might error with a segmentation
fault. Usually, there is no good reason to write code like this, but it is
possible.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let address = 0x012345usize;
    let r = address as *const i32;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-2: Creating a raw pointer to an arbitrary
memory address</span></p>
<p>Recall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can’t <em>dereference</em>
raw pointers and read the data being pointed to. In Listing 19-3, we use the
dereference operator <code>*</code> on a raw pointer that requires an <code>unsafe</code> block.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &amp;num as *const i32;
    let r2 = &amp;mut num as *mut i32;

    unsafe {
        println!(&quot;r1 is: {}&quot;, *r1);
        println!(&quot;r2 is: {}&quot;, *r2);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-3: Dereferencing raw pointers within an
<code>unsafe</code> block</span></p>
<p>Creating a pointer does no harm; it’s only when we try to access the value that
it points at that we might end up dealing with an invalid value.</p>
<p>Note also that in Listing 19-1 and 19-3, we created <code>*const i32</code> and <code>*mut i32</code>
raw pointers that both pointed to the same memory location, where <code>num</code> is
stored. If we instead tried to create an immutable and a mutable reference to
<code>num</code>, the code would not have compiled because Rust’s ownership rules don’t
allow a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable references. With
raw pointers, we can create a mutable pointer and an immutable pointer to the
same location and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially creating
a data race. Be careful!</p>
<p>With all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers? One major use
case is when interfacing with C code, as you’ll see in the next section,
<a href="ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#calling-an-unsafe-function-or-method">“Calling an Unsafe Function or
Method.”</a><!-- ignore --> Another case is
when building up safe abstractions that the borrow checker doesn’t understand.
We’ll introduce unsafe functions and then look at an example of a safe
abstraction that uses unsafe code.</p>
<h3 id="calling-an-unsafe-function-or-method"><a class="header" href="#calling-an-unsafe-function-or-method">Calling an Unsafe Function or Method</a></h3>
<p>The second type of operation you can perform in an unsafe block is calling
unsafe functions. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular
functions and methods, but they have an extra <code>unsafe</code> before the rest of the
definition. The <code>unsafe</code> keyword in this context indicates the function has
requirements we need to uphold when we call this function, because Rust can’t
guarantee we’ve met these requirements. By calling an unsafe function within an
<code>unsafe</code> block, we’re saying that we’ve read this function’s documentation and
take responsibility for upholding the function’s contracts.</p>
<p>Here is an unsafe function named <code>dangerous</code> that doesn’t do anything in its
body:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    unsafe fn dangerous() {}

    unsafe {
        dangerous();
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We must call the <code>dangerous</code> function within a separate <code>unsafe</code> block. If we
try to call <code>dangerous</code> without the <code>unsafe</code> block, we’ll get an error:</p>

<p>With the <code>unsafe</code> block, we’re asserting to Rust that we’ve read the function’s

unsafe operations within an unsafe function, we don’t need to add another

<p>Just because a function contains unsafe code doesn’t mean we need to mark the
entire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe function is
a common abstraction. As an example, let’s study the <code>split_at_mut</code> function
from the standard library, which requires some unsafe code. We’ll explore how
we might implement it. This safe method is defined on mutable slices: it takes
one slice and makes it two by splitting the slice at the index given as an
argument. Listing 19-4 shows how to use <code>split_at_mut</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>Rust’s borrow checker can’t understand that we’re borrowing different parts of
the slice; it only knows that we’re borrowing from the same slice twice.
Borrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay because the two
slices aren’t overlapping, but Rust isn’t smart enough to know this. When we
know code is okay, but Rust doesn’t, it’s time to reach for unsafe code.</p>
<p>Listing 19-6 shows how to use an <code>unsafe</code> block, a raw pointer, and some calls
to unsafe functions to make the implementation of <code>split_at_mut</code> work.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::slice;

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-6: Using unsafe code in the implementation of
the <code>split_at_mut</code> function</span></p>
<p>Recall from <a href="ch04-03-slices.html#the-slice-type">“The Slice Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 4 that slices are a pointer to some data and the length of the slice.
We use the <code>len</code> method to get the length of a slice and the <code>as_mut_ptr</code>
method to access the raw pointer of a slice. In this case, because we have a
mutable slice to <code>i32</code> values, <code>as_mut_ptr</code> returns a raw pointer with the type
<code>*mut i32</code>, which we’ve stored in the variable <code>ptr</code>.</p>
<p>We keep the assertion that the <code>mid</code> index is within the slice. Then we get to
the unsafe code: the <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> function takes a raw pointer
and a length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create a slice
that starts from <code>ptr</code> and is <code>mid</code> items long. Then we call the <code>add</code>
method on <code>ptr</code> with <code>mid</code> as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at
<code>mid</code>, and we create a slice using that pointer and the remaining number of
items after <code>mid</code> as the length.</p>
<p>The function <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> is unsafe because it takes a raw
pointer and must trust that this pointer is valid. The <code>add</code> method on raw
pointers is also unsafe, because it must trust that the offset location is also
a valid pointer. Therefore, we had to put an <code>unsafe</code> block around our calls to
<code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> and <code>add</code> so we could call them. By looking at
the code and by adding the assertion that <code>mid</code> must be less than or equal to
<code>len</code>, we can tell that all the raw pointers used within the <code>unsafe</code> block
will be valid pointers to data within the slice. This is an acceptable and
appropriate use of <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we don’t need to mark the resulting <code>split_at_mut</code> function as
<code>unsafe</code>, and we can call this function from safe Rust. We’ve created a safe
abstraction to the unsafe code with an implementation of the function that uses
<code>unsafe</code> code in a safe way, because it creates only valid pointers from the
data this function has access to.</p>
<p>In contrast, the use of <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> in Listing 19-7 would
likely crash when the slice is used. This code takes an arbitrary memory
location and creates a slice 10,000 items long.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-7: Creating a slice from an arbitrary memory

<p>We don’t own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there is no guarantee
that the slice this code creates contains valid <code>i32</code> values. Attempting to use
<code>values</code> as though it’s a valid slice results in undefined behavior.</p>
<h4 id="using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code"><a class="header" href="#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code">Using <code>extern</code> Functions to Call External Code</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes, your Rust code might need to interact with code written in another
language. For this, Rust has the keyword <code>extern</code> that facilitates the creation
and use of a <em>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</em>. An FFI is a way for a
programming language to define functions and enable a different (foreign)
programming language to call those functions.</p>
<p>Listing 19-8 demonstrates how to set up an integration with the <code>abs</code> function
from the C standard library. Functions declared within <code>extern</code> blocks are
always unsafe to call from Rust code. The reason is that other languages don’t
enforce Rust’s rules and guarantees, and Rust can’t check them, so
responsibility falls on the programmer to ensure safety.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn abs(input: i32) -&gt; i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!(&quot;Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}&quot;, abs(-3));
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-8: Declaring and calling an <code>extern</code> function
defined in another language</span></p>
<p>Within the <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code> block, we list the names and signatures of external
functions from another language we want to call. The <code>&quot;C&quot;</code> part defines which
<em>application binary interface (ABI)</em> the external function uses: the ABI
defines how to call the function at the assembly level. The <code>&quot;C&quot;</code> ABI is the
most common and follows the C programming language’s ABI.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="calling-rust-functions-from-other-languages"><a class="header" href="#calling-rust-functions-from-other-languages">Calling Rust Functions from Other Languages</a></h4>
<p>We can also use <code>extern</code> to create an interface that allows other languages
to call Rust functions. Instead of creating a whole <code>extern</code> block, we add
the <code>extern</code> keyword and specify the ABI to use just before the <code>fn</code> keyword
for the relevant function. We also need to add a <code>#[no_mangle]</code> annotation to
tell the Rust compiler not to mangle the name of this function. <em>Mangling</em> is
when a compiler changes the name we’ve given a function to a different name
that contains more information for other parts of the compilation process to
consume but is less human readable. Every programming language compiler
mangles names slightly differently, so for a Rust function to be nameable by
other languages, we must disable the Rust compiler’s name mangling.</p>
<p>In the following example, we make the <code>call_from_c</code> function accessible from
C code, after it’s compiled to a shared library and linked from C:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn call_from_c() {
    println!(&quot;Just called a Rust function from C!&quot;);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This usage of <code>extern</code> does not require <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="accessing-or-modifying-a-mutable-static-variable"><a class="header" href="#accessing-or-modifying-a-mutable-static-variable">Accessing or Modifying a Mutable Static Variable</a></h3>
<p>In this book, we’ve not yet talked about <em>global variables</em>, which Rust does
support but can be problematic with Rust’s ownership rules. If two threads are
accessing the same mutable global variable, it can cause a data race.</p>
<p>In Rust, global variables are called <em>static</em> variables. Listing 19-9 shows an
example declaration and use of a static variable with a string slice as a
value.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">static HELLO_WORLD: &amp;str = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;name is: {}&quot;, HELLO_WORLD);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-9: Defining and using an immutable static
variable</span></p>
<p>Static variables are similar to constants, which we discussed in the
<a href="ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#constants">“Differences Between Variables and
Constants”</a><!-- ignore --> section
in Chapter 3. The names of static variables are in <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code> by
convention. Static variables can only store references with the <code>'static</code>
lifetime, which means the Rust compiler can figure out the lifetime and we
aren’t required to annotate it explicitly. Accessing an immutable static
variable is safe.</p>
<p>A subtle difference between constants and immutable static variables is that
values in a static variable have a fixed address in memory. Using the value
will always access the same data. Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to
duplicate their data whenever they’re used. Another difference is that static
variables can be mutable. Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is
<em>unsafe</em>. Listing 19-10 shows how to declare, access, and modify a mutable
static variable named <code>COUNTER</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;

fn add_to_count(inc: u32) {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += inc;
    }
}

fn main() {
    add_to_count(3);

    unsafe {
        println!(&quot;COUNTER: {}&quot;, COUNTER);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-10: Reading from or writing to a mutable
static variable is unsafe</span></p>
<p>As with regular variables, we specify mutability using the <code>mut</code> keyword. Any
code that reads or writes from <code>COUNTER</code> must be within an <code>unsafe</code> block. This
code compiles and prints <code>COUNTER: 3</code> as we would expect because it’s single
threaded. Having multiple threads access <code>COUNTER</code> would likely result in data
races.</p>
<p>With mutable data that is globally accessible, it’s difficult to ensure there
are no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static variables to be
unsafe. Where possible, it’s preferable to use the concurrency techniques and
thread-safe smart pointers we discussed in Chapter 16 so the compiler checks
that data accessed from different threads is done safely.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-an-unsafe-trait"><a class="header" href="#implementing-an-unsafe-trait">Implementing an Unsafe Trait</a></h3>
<p>We can use <code>unsafe</code> to implement an unsafe trait. A trait is unsafe when at
least one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler can’t verify. We
declare that a trait is <code>unsafe</code> by adding the <code>unsafe</code> keyword before <code>trait</code>
and marking the implementation of the trait as <code>unsafe</code> too, as shown in
Listing 19-11.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}

fn main() {}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-11: Defining and implementing an unsafe
trait</span></p>
<p>By using <code>unsafe impl</code>, we’re promising that we’ll uphold the invariants that
the compiler can’t verify.</p>
<p>As an example, recall the <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code> marker traits we discussed in the
<a href="ch16-04-extensible-concurrency-sync-and-send.html#extensible-concurrency-with-the-sync-and-send-traits">“Extensible Concurrency with the <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code>
Traits”</a><!-- ignore -->
section in Chapter 16: the compiler implements these traits automatically if
our types are composed entirely of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> types. If we implement a
type that contains a type that is not <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, such as raw pointers,
and we want to mark that type as <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, we must use <code>unsafe</code>. Rust
can’t verify that our type upholds the guarantees that it can be safely sent
across threads or accessed from multiple threads; therefore, we need to do
those checks manually and indicate as such with <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-fields-of-a-union"><a class="header" href="#accessing-fields-of-a-union">Accessing Fields of a Union</a></h3>
<p>The final action that works only with <code>unsafe</code> is accessing fields of a
<em>union</em>. A <code>union</code> is similar to a <code>struct</code>, but only one declared field is
used in a particular instance at one time. Unions are primarily used to
interface with unions in C code. Accessing union fields is unsafe because Rust
can’t guarantee the type of the data currently being stored in the union
instance. You can learn more about unions in <a href="../reference/items/unions.html">the Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-unsafe-code"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-unsafe-code">When to Use Unsafe Code</a></h3>
<p>Using <code>unsafe</code> to take one of the five actions (superpowers) just discussed
isn’t wrong or even frowned upon. But it is trickier to get <code>unsafe</code> code
correct because the compiler can’t help uphold memory safety. When you have a
reason to use <code>unsafe</code> code, you can do so, and having the explicit <code>unsafe</code>
annotation makes it easier to track down the source of problems when they occur.</p>

<p>We first covered traits in the <a href="ch10-02-traits.html#traits-defining-shared-behavior">“Traits: Defining Shared
Behavior”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter
10, but we didn’t discuss the more advanced details. Now that you know more
about Rust, we can get into the nitty-gritty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Associated types</em> connect a <em>type placeholder</em> with a trait such that the trait
method definitions can use these placeholder types in their signatures. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The implementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the
placeholder type for the particular implementation. </li>
<li>That way, we can define a
trait that uses some types without needing to know exactly what those types are
until the trait is implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve described most of the advanced features in this chapter as being rarely
needed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Associated types are somewhere in the middle: they’re used more rarely
than features explained in the rest of the book but more commonly than many of
the other features discussed in this chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One example of a trait with an associated type is the <code>Iterator</code> trait that the
standard library provides. </li>
<li>The associated type is named <code>Item</code> and stands in
for the type of the values the type implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait is
iterating over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of the <code>Iterator</code> trait is as shown in Listing 19-12.</p>

</details>
<p>The difference is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>when using generics, as in Listing 19-13, we must
annotate the types in each implementation; because we can also implement
<code>Iterator&lt;String&gt; for Counter</code> or any other type, we could have multiple
implementations of <code>Iterator</code> for <code>Counter</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, when a trait has a
generic parameter, it can be implemented for a type multiple times, changing
the concrete types of the generic type parameters each time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we use the
<code>next</code> method on <code>Counter</code>, we would have to provide type annotations to
indicate which implementation of <code>Iterator</code> we want to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With associated types, we don’t need to annotate types because we can’t
implement a trait on a type multiple times. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In Listing 19-12 with the
definition that uses associated types, we can only choose what the type of
<code>Item</code> will be once, because there can only be one <code>impl Iterator for Counter</code>.
We don’t have to specify that we want an iterator of <code>u32</code> values everywhere
that we call <code>next</code> on <code>Counter</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Associated types also become part of the trait’s contract: </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>implementors of the
trait must provide a type to stand in for the associated type placeholder.</li>
<li>Associated types often have a name that describes how the type will be used</li>
<li>and documenting the associated type in the API documentation is good practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading"><a class="header" href="#default-generic-type-parameters-and-operator-overloading">Default Generic Type Parameters and Operator Overloading</a></h2>
<p>When we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete type for
the generic type. </p>
<p>This eliminates the need for implementors of the trait to
specify a concrete type if the default type works. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You specify a default type
when declaring a generic type with the <code>&lt;PlaceholderType=ConcreteType&gt;</code> syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great example of a situation where this technique is useful is with <em>operator
overloading</em>, in which you customize the behavior of an operator (such as <code>+</code>)
in particular situations.</p>
<p>Rust doesn’t allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary
operators. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed
in <code>std::ops</code> by implementing the traits associated with the operator. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For
example, in Listing 19-14 we overload the <code>+</code> operator to add two <code>Point</code>
instances together. We do this by implementing the <code>Add</code> trait on a <code>Point</code>
struct:</p>

the <code>Add</code> trait where we want to customize the <code>Rhs</code> type rather than using the

<p>Because the <code>fly</code> method takes a <code>self</code> parameter, if we had two <em>types</em> that
both implement one <em>trait</em>, Rust could figure out which implementation of a
trait to use based on the type of <code>self</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, <em>associated functions</em> that are not methods don’t have a <code>self</code>
parameter. When there are multiple types or traits that define non-method
functions with the same function name, Rust doesn’t always know which type you
mean unless you use <em>fully qualified syntax</em>. </p>

<p>In Chapter 10 in the <a href="ch10-02-traits.html#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type">“Implementing a Trait on a

<em>orphan rule</em> that states we’re only allowed to implement a trait on a type if
either the trait or the type are local to our crate. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to get
around this restriction using the <em>newtype pattern</em>, which involves creating a
new type in a tuple struct. (We covered tuple structs in the <a href="ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">“Using Tuple
Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types”</a><!--

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The tuple struct will have one field and be a
thin wrapper around the type we want to implement a trait for. </li>
<li>Then the wrapper
type is local to our crate, and we can implement the trait on the wrapper.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Newtype</em> is a term that originates from the Haskell programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no runtime performance penalty for using this pattern, and the wrapper
type is elided at compile time.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>let’s say we want to implement <code>Display</code> on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, which the
orphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the <code>Display</code> trait and the
<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> type are defined outside our crate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can make a <code>Wrapper</code> struct
that holds an instance of <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then we can implement <code>Display</code> on
<code>Wrapper</code> and use the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> value, as shown in Listing 19-23.</p>

tuple. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we can use the functionality of the <code>Display</code> type on <code>Wrapper</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The downside of using this technique is that <code>Wrapper</code> is a new type, so it
doesn’t have the methods of the value it’s holding. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We would have to implement
all the methods of <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> directly on <code>Wrapper</code> such that the methods
delegate to <code>self.0</code>, which would allow us to treat <code>Wrapper</code> exactly like a
<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If we wanted the new type to have every method the inner type has,
implementing the <code>Deref</code> trait (discussed in Chapter 15 in the <a href="ch15-02-deref.html#treating-smart-pointers-like-regular-references-with-the-deref-trait">“Treating Smart
Pointers Like Regular References with the <code>Deref</code>
Trait”</a><!-- ignore --> section) on the <code>Wrapper</code> to return
the inner type would be a solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we don’t want the <code>Wrapper</code> type to have
all the methods of the inner type—for example, to restrict the <code>Wrapper</code> type’s
behavior—we would have to implement just the methods we do want manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This newtype pattern is also useful even when traits are not involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s
switch focus and look at some advanced ways to interact with Rust’s type system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="advanced-types"><a class="header" href="#advanced-types">Advanced Types</a></h2>
<p>The Rust type system has some features that we’ve so far mentioned but haven’t
yet discussed. We’ll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why
newtypes are useful as types. Then we’ll move on to type aliases, a feature
similar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics. We’ll also discuss
the <code>!</code> type and dynamically sized types.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction"><a class="header" href="#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction">Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This section assumes you’ve read the earlier section <a href="ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types">“Using the
Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External
Types.”</a><!-- ignore --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The newtype pattern is also useful for tasks beyond those we’ve discussed so
far, including statically enforcing that values are never confused and
indicating the units of a value. You saw an example of using newtypes to
indicate units in Listing 19-15: recall that the <code>Millimeters</code> and <code>Meters</code>
structs wrapped <code>u32</code> values in a newtype. If we wrote a function with a
parameter of type <code>Millimeters</code>, we couldn’t compile a program that
accidentally tried to call that function with a value of type <code>Meters</code> or a
plain <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p>We can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation
details of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is different from
the API of the private inner type.</p>
<p>Newtypes can also hide internal implementation. For example, we could provide a
<code>People</code> type to wrap a <code>HashMap&lt;i32, String&gt;</code> that stores a person’s ID
associated with their name. Code using <code>People</code> would only interact with the
public API we provide, such as a method to add a name string to the <code>People</code>
collection; that code wouldn’t need to know that we assign an <code>i32</code> ID to names
internally. The newtype pattern is a lightweight way to achieve encapsulation
to hide implementation details, which we discussed in the <a href="ch17-01-what-is-oo.html#encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details">“Encapsulation that
Hides Implementation
Details”</a><!-- ignore -->
section of Chapter 17.</p>
<h3 id="creating-type-synonyms-with-type-aliases"><a class="header" href="#creating-type-synonyms-with-type-aliases">Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases</a></h3>
<p>Rust provides the ability to declare a <em>type alias</em> to give an existing type
another name. For this we use the <code>type</code> keyword. For example, we can create
the alias <code>Kilometers</code> to <code>i32</code> like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    type Kilometers = i32;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let x: i32 = 5;
</span><span class="boring">    let y: Kilometers = 5;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;x + y = {}&quot;, x + y);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, the alias <code>Kilometers</code> is a <em>synonym</em> for <code>i32</code>; unlike the <code>Millimeters</code>
and <code>Meters</code> types we created in Listing 19-15, <code>Kilometers</code> is not a separate,
new type. Values that have the type <code>Kilometers</code> will be treated the same as
values of type <code>i32</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    type Kilometers = i32;

    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: Kilometers = 5;

    println!(&quot;x + y = {}&quot;, x + y);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Because <code>Kilometers</code> and <code>i32</code> are the same type, we can add values of both
types and we can pass <code>Kilometers</code> values to functions that take <code>i32</code>
parameters. However, using this method, we don’t get the type checking benefits
that we get from the newtype pattern discussed earlier. In other words, if we
mix up <code>Kilometers</code> and <code>i32</code> values somewhere, the compiler will not give us
an error.</p>
<p>The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we
might have a lengthy type like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Writing this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations all
over the code can be tiresome and error prone. Imagine having a project full of
code like that in Listing 19-24.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let f: Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; = Box::new(|| println!(&quot;hi&quot;));

    fn takes_long_type(f: Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;) {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; {
        // --snip--
<span class="boring">        Box::new(|| ())
</span>    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-24: Using a long type in many places</span></p>
<p>A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition. In
Listing 19-25, we’ve introduced an alias named <code>Thunk</code> for the verbose type and
can replace all uses of the type with the shorter alias <code>Thunk</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    type Thunk = Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;;

    let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!(&quot;hi&quot;));

    fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Thunk {
        // --snip--
<span class="boring">        Box::new(|| ())
</span>    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-25: Introducing a type alias <code>Thunk</code> to reduce
repetition</span></p>
<p>This code is much easier to read and write! Choosing a meaningful name for a
type alias can help communicate your intent as well (<em>thunk</em> is a word for code
to be evaluated at a later time, so it’s an appropriate name for a closure that
gets stored).</p>
<p>Type aliases are also commonly used with the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type for reducing
repetition. Consider the <code>std::io</code> module in the standard library. I/O
operations often return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> to handle situations when operations
fail to work. This library has a <code>std::io::Error</code> struct that represents all
possible I/O errors. Many of the functions in <code>std::io</code> will be returning
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the <code>E</code> is <code>std::io::Error</code>, such as these functions in
the <code>Write</code> trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt;
use std::io::Error;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize, Error&gt;;
    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;

    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;
    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Result&lt;..., Error&gt;</code> is repeated a lot. As such, <code>std::io</code> has this type
alias declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::fmt;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, std::io::Error&gt;;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">pub trait Write {
</span><span class="boring">    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because this declaration is in the <code>std::io</code> module, we can use the fully
qualified alias <code>std::io::Result&lt;T&gt;</code>; that is, a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with the <code>E</code>
filled in as <code>std::io::Error</code>. The <code>Write</code> trait function signatures end up
looking like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">use std::fmt;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, std::io::Error&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>pub trait Write {
    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize&gt;;
    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;

    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type alias helps in two ways: it makes code easier to write <em>and</em> it gives
us a consistent interface across all of <code>std::io</code>. Because it’s an alias, it’s
just another <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which means we can use any methods that work on
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with it, as well as special syntax like the <code>?</code> operator.</p>
<h3 id="the-never-type-that-never-returns"><a class="header" href="#the-never-type-that-never-returns">The Never Type that Never Returns</a></h3>
<p>Rust has a special type named <code>!</code> that’s known in type theory lingo as the
<em>empty type</em> because it has no values. We prefer to call it the <em>never type</em>
because it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never
return. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">fn bar() -&gt; ! {
    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    panic!();
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>This code is read as “the function <code>bar</code> returns never.” Functions that return
never are called <em>diverging functions</em>. We can’t create values of the type <code>!</code>
so <code>bar</code> can never possibly return.</p>
<p>But what use is a type you can never create values for? Recall the code from
Listing 2-5, part of the number guessing game; we’ve reproduced a bit of it
here in Listing 19-26.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-26: A <code>match</code> with an arm that ends in
<code>continue</code></span></p>
<p>At the time, we skipped over some details in this code. In Chapter 6 in <a href="ch06-02-match.html#the-match-control-flow-operator">“The
<code>match</code> Control Flow Operator”</a><!-- ignore -->
section, we discussed that <code>match</code> arms must all return the same type. So, for
example, the following code doesn’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let guess = &quot;3&quot;;
</span>    let guess = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(_) =&gt; 5,
        Err(_) =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;,
    };
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>guess</code> in this code would have to be an integer <em>and</em> a string,
and Rust requires that <code>guess</code> have only one type. So what does <code>continue</code>
return? How were we allowed to return a <code>u32</code> from one arm and have another arm
that ends with <code>continue</code> in Listing 19-26?</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, <code>continue</code> has a <code>!</code> value. That is, when Rust
computes the type of <code>guess</code>, it looks at both match arms, the former with a
value of <code>u32</code> and the latter with a <code>!</code> value. Because <code>!</code> can never have a
value, Rust decides that the type of <code>guess</code> is <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p>The formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type <code>!</code> can
be coerced into any other type. We’re allowed to end this <code>match</code> arm with
<code>continue</code> because <code>continue</code> doesn’t return a value; instead, it moves control
back to the top of the loop, so in the <code>Err</code> case, we never assign a value to
<code>guess</code>.</p>
<p>The never type is useful with the <code>panic!</code> macro as well. Recall the <code>unwrap</code>
function that we call on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> values to produce a value or panic with
this definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span class="boring">    Some(T),
</span><span class="boring">    None,
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">use crate::Option::*;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
    pub fn unwrap(self) -&gt; T {
        match self {
            Some(val) =&gt; val,
            None =&gt; panic!(&quot;called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value&quot;),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, the same thing happens as in the <code>match</code> in Listing 19-26: Rust
sees that <code>val</code> has the type <code>T</code> and <code>panic!</code> has the type <code>!</code>, so the result
of the overall <code>match</code> expression is <code>T</code>. This code works because <code>panic!</code>
doesn’t produce a value; it ends the program. In the <code>None</code> case, we won’t be
returning a value from <code>unwrap</code>, so this code is valid.</p>
<p>One final expression that has the type <code>!</code> is a <code>loop</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    print!(&quot;forever &quot;);

    loop {
        print!(&quot;and ever &quot;);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, the loop never ends, so <code>!</code> is the value of the expression. However, this
wouldn’t be true if we included a <code>break</code>, because the loop would terminate
when it got to the <code>break</code>.</p>
<h3 id="dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait"><a class="header" href="#dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait">Dynamically Sized Types and the <code>Sized</code> Trait</a></h3>
<p>Rust needs to know certain details about its types, such as how much space to
allocate for a value of a particular type. This leaves one corner of its type
system a little confusing at first: the concept of <em>dynamically sized types</em>.
Sometimes referred to as <em>DSTs</em> or <em>unsized types</em>, these types let us write
code using values whose size we can know only at runtime.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the details of a dynamically sized type called <code>str</code>, which
we’ve been using throughout the book. That’s right, not <code>&amp;str</code>, but <code>str</code> on
its own, is a DST. We can’t know how long the string is until runtime, meaning
we can’t create a variable of type <code>str</code>, nor can we take an argument of type
<code>str</code>. Consider the following code, which does not work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1: str = &quot;Hello there!&quot;;
    let s2: str = &quot;How's it going?&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any value of a particular
type, and all values of a type must use the same amount of memory. If Rust
allowed us to write this code, these two <code>str</code> values would need to take up the
same amount of space. But they have different lengths: <code>s1</code> needs 12 bytes of
storage and <code>s2</code> needs 15. This is why it’s not possible to create a variable
holding a dynamically sized type.</p>
<p>So what do we do? In this case, you already know the answer: we make the types
of <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> a <code>&amp;str</code> rather than a <code>str</code>. Recall from the <a href="ch04-03-slices.html#string-slices">“String
Slices”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 4 that the slice data
structure just stores the starting position and the length of the slice. So
although a <code>&amp;T</code> is a single value that stores the memory address of where the
<code>T</code> is located, a <code>&amp;str</code> is <em>two</em> values: the address of the <code>str</code> and its
length. As such, we can know the size of a <code>&amp;str</code> value at compile time: it’s
twice the length of a <code>usize</code>. That is, we always know the size of a <code>&amp;str</code>, no
matter how long the string it refers to is. In general, this is the way in
which dynamically sized types are used in Rust: they have an extra bit of
metadata that stores the size of the dynamic information. The golden rule of
dynamically sized types is that we must always put values of dynamically sized
types behind a pointer of some kind.</p>
<p>We can combine <code>str</code> with all kinds of pointers: for example, <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code> or
<code>Rc&lt;str&gt;</code>. In fact, you’ve seen this before but with a different dynamically
sized type: traits. Every trait is a dynamically sized type we can refer to by
using the name of the trait. In Chapter 17 in the <a href="ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types">“Using Trait Objects That
Allow for Values of Different
Types”</a><!--
ignore --> section, we mentioned that to use traits as trait objects, we must
put them behind a pointer, such as <code>&amp;dyn Trait</code> or <code>Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;</code> (<code>Rc&lt;dyn Trait&gt;</code> would work too).</p>
<p>To work with DSTs, Rust provides the <code>Sized</code> trait to determine whether or not
a type’s size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented
for everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust
implicitly adds a bound on <code>Sized</code> to every generic function. That is, a
generic function definition like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T&gt;(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>is actually treated as though we had written this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T: Sized&gt;(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known size at
compile time. However, you can use the following special syntax to relax this
restriction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;(t: &amp;T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>A trait bound on <code>?Sized</code> means “<code>T</code> may or may not be <code>Sized</code>” and this
notation overrides the default that generic types must have a known size at
compile time. The <code>?Trait</code> syntax with this meaning is only available for
<code>Sized</code>, not any other traits.</p>
<p>Also note that we switched the type of the <code>t</code> parameter from <code>T</code> to <code>&amp;T</code>.
Because the type might not be <code>Sized</code>, we need to use it behind some kind of
pointer. In this case, we’ve chosen a reference.</p>

<p>This section explores some advanced features related to functions and closures,
including function pointers and returning closures.</p>
<h2 id="function-pointers-1"><a class="header" href="#function-pointers-1">Function Pointers</a></h2>
<p>We’ve talked about how to pass closures to functions; you can also pass regular
functions to functions!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This technique is useful when you want to pass a
function you’ve already defined rather than defining a new closure.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Functions coerce to the type <code>fn</code> (with a lowercase f), not to be confused with the <code>Fn</code>
closure trait.</li>
<li>The <code>fn</code> type is called a <em>function pointer</em>.</li>
<li>Passing functions with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments to other functions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is similar to
that of closures, as shown in Listing 19-27, where we’ve defined a function
<code>add_one</code> that adds one to its parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The function <code>do_twice</code> takes two
parameters: a function pointer to any function that takes an <code>i32</code> parameter
and returns an <code>i32</code>, and one <code>i32 value</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>do_twice</code> function calls the
function <code>f</code> twice, passing it the <code>arg</code> value, then adds the two function call
results together.</li>
<li>The <code>main</code> function calls <code>do_twice</code> with the arguments
<code>add_one</code> and <code>5</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore">fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -&gt; i32, arg: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);

    println!(&quot;The answer is: {}&quot;, answer);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-27: Using the <code>fn</code> type to accept a function
pointer as an argument</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This code prints <code>The answer is: 12</code>.</li>
<li>We specify that the parameter <code>f</code> in
<code>do_twice</code> is an <code>fn</code> that takes one parameter of type <code>i32</code> and returns an
<code>i32</code>.</li>
<li>We can then call <code>f</code> in the body of <code>do_twice</code>. In <code>main</code>, we can pass
the function name <code>add_one</code> as the first argument to <code>do_twice</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike closures, <code>fn</code> is a type rather than a trait, so we specify <code>fn</code> as the
parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one
of the <code>Fn</code> traits as a trait bound.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Function pointers implement all three of the closure traits (<code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and
<code>FnOnce</code>), meaning you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a
function that expects a closure.</li>
<li>It’s best to write functions using a generic
type and one of the closure traits so your functions can accept either
functions or closures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, one example of where you would want to only accept <code>fn</code> and not
closures is when interfacing with external code that doesn’t have closures: C
functions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn’t have closures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or a named
function, let’s look at a use of the <code>map</code> method provided by the <code>Iterator</code>
trait in the standard library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the <code>map</code> function to turn a vector of
numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(|i| i.to_string()).collect();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or we could name a function as the argument to <code>map</code> instead of the closure,
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we must use the <code>fully qualified syntax</code> that we talked about earlier
in the <a href="ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#advanced-traits">“Advanced Traits”</a><!-- ignore --> section because
there are multiple functions available named <code>to_string</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we’re using the

library has implemented for any type that implements <code>Display</code>.</p>
<p>Recall from the <a href="ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#enum-values">“Enum values”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter
6 that the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes an initializer
function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can use these initializer functions as function pointers that
implement the closure traits, which means we can specify the initializer
functions as arguments for methods that take closures, like so:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-rust  ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum Status {
        Value(u32),
        Stop,
    }

    let list_of_statuses: Vec&lt;Status&gt; = (0u32..20).map(Status::Value).collect();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here we create <code>Status::Value</code> instances using each <code>u32</code> value in the range
that <code>map</code> is called on by using the initializer function of <code>Status::Value</code>.</p>
</li>

<p>Some people prefer this style, and some people prefer to use closures. They
compile to the same code, so use whichever style is clearer to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="returning-closures"><a class="header" href="#returning-closures">Returning Closures</a></h2>
<p>Closures are represented by traits, which means you can’t return closures
directly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead
use the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the

<p>Next, let’s look at macros!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="macros"><a class="header" href="#macros">Macros</a></h2>
<p>We’ve used macros like <code>println!</code> throughout this book, but we haven’t fully
explored what a macro is and how it works. The term <em>macro</em> refers to a family
of features in Rust: <em>declarative</em> macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> and three kinds
of <em>procedural</em> macros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom <code>#[derive]</code> macros that specify code added with the <code>derive</code> attribute
used on structs and enums</li>
<li>Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item</li>
<li>Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens
specified as their argument</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let’s look at why we even
need macros when we already have functions.</p>
<h3 id="the-difference-between-macros-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#the-difference-between-macros-and-functions">The Difference Between Macros and Functions</a></h3>
<p>Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which
is known as <em>metaprogramming</em>. In Appendix C, we discuss the <code>derive</code>
attribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for you. We’ve
also used the <code>println!</code> and <code>vec!</code> macros throughout the book. All of these
macros <em>expand</em> to produce more code than the code you’ve written manually.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and
maintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have
some additional powers that functions don’t.</p>
<p>A function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the
function has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of
parameters: we can call <code>println!(&quot;hello&quot;)</code> with one argument or
<code>println!(&quot;hello {}&quot;, name)</code> with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded
before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for
example, implement a trait on a given type. A function can’t, because it gets
called at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.</p>
<p>The downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro
definitions are more complex than function definitions because you’re writing
Rust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are
generally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function
definitions.</p>
<p>Another important difference between macros and functions is that you must
define macros or bring them into scope <em>before</em> you call them in a file, as
opposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming"><a class="header" href="#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">Declarative Macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> for General Metaprogramming</a></h3>
<p>The most widely used form of macros in Rust is the <em>declarative macro</em>. These
are also sometimes referred to as “macros by example,” “<code>macro_rules!</code> macros,”
or just plain “macros.” At their core, declarative macros allow you to write
something similar to a Rust <code>match</code> expression. As discussed in Chapter 6,
<code>match</code> expressions are control structures that take an expression, compare the
resulting value of the expression to patterns, and then run the code associated
with the matching pattern. Macros also compare a value to patterns that are
associated with particular code: in this situation, the value is the literal
Rust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared with the
structure of that source code; and the code associated with each pattern, when
matched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during
compilation.</p>
<p>To define a macro, you use the <code>macro_rules!</code> construct. Let’s explore how to
use <code>macro_rules!</code> by looking at how the <code>vec!</code> macro is defined. Chapter 8
covered how we can use the <code>vec!</code> macro to create a new vector with particular
values. For example, the following macro creates a new vector containing three
integers:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let v: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We could also use the <code>vec!</code> macro to make a vector of two integers or a vector
of five string slices. We wouldn’t be able to use a function to do the same
because we wouldn’t know the number or type of values up front.</p>
<p>Listing 19-28 shows a slightly simplified definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) =&gt; {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-28: A simplified version of the <code>vec!</code> macro
definition</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The actual definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro in the standard library
includes code to preallocate the correct amount of memory up front. That code
is an optimization that we don’t include here to make the example simpler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>#[macro_export]</code> annotation indicates that this macro should be made
available whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is brought into
scope. Without this annotation, the macro can’t be brought into scope.</p>
<p>We then start the macro definition with <code>macro_rules!</code> and the name of the
macro we’re defining <em>without</em> the exclamation mark. The name, in this case
<code>vec</code>, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.</p>
<p>The structure in the <code>vec!</code> body is similar to the structure of a <code>match</code>
expression. Here we have one arm with the pattern <code>( $( $x:expr ),* )</code>,
followed by <code>=&gt;</code> and the block of code associated with this pattern. If the
pattern matches, the associated block of code will be emitted. Given that this
is the only pattern in this macro, there is only one valid way to match; any
other pattern will result in an error. More complex macros will have more than
one arm.</p>
<p>Valid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different than the pattern syntax
covered in Chapter 18 because macro patterns are matched against Rust code
structure rather than values. Let’s walk through what the pattern pieces in
Listing 19-28 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see the <a href="../reference/macros-by-example.html">Rust
Reference</a>.</p>
<p>First, we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern. We use a
dollar sign (<code>$</code>) to declare a variable in the macro system that will contain
the Rust code matching the pattern. The dollar sign makes it clear this is a
macro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable. Next comes a set of
parentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses
for use in the replacement code. Within <code>$()</code> is <code>$x:expr</code>, which matches any
Rust expression and gives the expression the name <code>$x</code>.</p>
<p>The comma following <code>$()</code> indicates that a literal comma separator character
could optionally appear after the code that matches the code in <code>$()</code>. The <code>*</code>
specifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes the <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>When we call this macro with <code>vec![1, 2, 3];</code>, the <code>$x</code> pattern matches three
times with the three expressions <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with this arm:
<code>temp_vec.push()</code> within <code>$()*</code> is generated for each part that matches <code>$()</code>
in the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern
matches. The <code>$x</code> is replaced with each expression matched. When we call this
macro with <code>vec![1, 2, 3];</code>, the code generated that replaces this macro call
will be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">{
    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
    temp_vec.push(1);
    temp_vec.push(2);
    temp_vec.push(3);
    temp_vec
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve defined a macro that can take any number of arguments of any type and can
generate code to create a vector containing the specified elements.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to write macros, consult the online documentation or
other resources, such as <a href="https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/">“The Little Book of Rust Macros”</a> started by
Daniel Keep and continued by Lukas Wirth.</p>
<h3 id="procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes"><a class="header" href="#procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes">Procedural Macros for Generating Code from Attributes</a></h3>
<p>The second form of macros is the <em>procedural macro</em>, which acts more like a
function (and is a type of procedure). Procedural macros accept some code as an
input, operate on that code, and produce some code as an output rather than
matching against patterns and replacing the code with other code as declarative
macros do. The three kinds of procedural macros are custom derive,
attribute-like, and function-like, and all work in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>When creating procedural macros, the definitions must reside in their own crate
with a special crate type. This is for complex technical reasons that we hope
to eliminate in the future. In Listing 19-29, we show how to define a
procedural macro, where <code>some_attribute</code> is a placeholder for using a specific
macro variety.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use proc_macro;

#[some_attribute]
pub fn some_name(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-29: An example of defining a procedural
macro</span></p>
<p>The function that defines a procedural macro takes a <code>TokenStream</code> as an input
and produces a <code>TokenStream</code> as an output. The <code>TokenStream</code> type is defined by
the <code>proc_macro</code> crate that is included with Rust and represents a sequence of
tokens. This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is
operating on makes up the input <code>TokenStream</code>, and the code the macro produces
is the output <code>TokenStream</code>. The function also has an attribute attached to it
that specifies which kind of procedural macro we’re creating. We can have
multiple kinds of procedural macros in the same crate.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the different kinds of procedural macros. We’ll start with a
custom derive macro and then explain the small dissimilarities that make the
other forms different.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-write-a-custom-derive-macro"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-a-custom-derive-macro">How to Write a Custom <code>derive</code> Macro</a></h3>
<p>Let’s create a crate named <code>hello_macro</code> that defines a trait named
<code>HelloMacro</code> with one associated function named <code>hello_macro</code>. Rather than
making our users implement the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait for each of their types,
we’ll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type with
<code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> to get a default implementation of the <code>hello_macro</code>
function. The default implementation will print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is TypeName!</code> where <code>TypeName</code> is the name of the type on which this trait has
been defined. In other words, we’ll write a crate that enables another
programmer to write code like Listing 19-30 using our crate.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">use hello_macro::HelloMacro;
use hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;

#[derive(HelloMacro)]
struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-30: The code a user of our crate will be able
to write when using our procedural macro</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!</code> when we’re done. The
first step is to make a new library crate, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello_macro --lib
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll define the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait and its associated function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait HelloMacro {
    fn hello_macro();
}
</code></pre>
<p>We have a trait and its function. At this point, our crate user could implement
the trait to achieve the desired functionality, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use hello_macro::HelloMacro;

struct Pancakes;

impl HelloMacro for Pancakes {
    fn hello_macro() {
        println!(&quot;Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!&quot;);
    }
}

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, they would need to write the implementation block for each type they
wanted to use with <code>hello_macro</code>; we want to spare them from having to do this
work.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can’t yet provide the <code>hello_macro</code> function with default
implementation that will print the name of the type the trait is implemented
on: Rust doesn’t have reflection capabilities, so it can’t look up the type’s
name at runtime. We need a macro to generate code at compile time.</p>
<p>The next step is to define the procedural macro. At the time of this writing,
procedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction
might be lifted. The convention for structuring crates and macro crates is as
follows: for a crate named <code>foo</code>, a custom derive procedural macro crate is
called <code>foo_derive</code>. Let’s start a new crate called <code>hello_macro_derive</code> inside
our <code>hello_macro</code> project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib
</code></pre>
<p>Our two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro crate
within the directory of our <code>hello_macro</code> crate. If we change the trait
definition in <code>hello_macro</code>, we’ll have to change the implementation of the
procedural macro in <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as well. The two crates will need to
be published separately, and programmers using these crates will need to add
both as dependencies and bring them both into scope. We could instead have the
<code>hello_macro</code> crate use <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as a dependency and re-export the
procedural macro code. However, the way we’ve structured the project makes it
possible for programmers to use <code>hello_macro</code> even if they don’t want the
<code>derive</code> functionality.</p>
<p>We need to declare the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> crate as a procedural macro crate.
We’ll also need functionality from the <code>syn</code> and <code>quote</code> crates, as you’ll see
in a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the following to the
<em>Cargo.toml</em> file for <code>hello_macro_derive</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello_macro_derive/Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lib]
proc-macro = true

[dependencies]
syn = &quot;1.0&quot;
quote = &quot;1.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>To start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing 19-31 into
your <em>src/lib.rs</em> file for the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> crate. Note that this code
won’t compile until we add a definition for the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">use proc_macro::TokenStream;
use quote::quote;
use syn;

#[proc_macro_derive(HelloMacro)]
pub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree
    // that we can manipulate
    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();

    // Build the trait implementation
    impl_hello_macro(&amp;ast)
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-31: Code that most procedural macro crates
will require in order to process Rust code</span></p>
<p>Notice that we’ve split the code into the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function, which
is responsible for parsing the <code>TokenStream</code>, and the <code>impl_hello_macro</code>
function, which is responsible for transforming the syntax tree: this makes
writing a procedural macro more convenient. The code in the outer function
(<code>hello_macro_derive</code> in this case) will be the same for almost every
procedural macro crate you see or create. The code you specify in the body of
the inner function (<code>impl_hello_macro</code> in this case) will be different
depending on your procedural macro’s purpose.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced three new crates: <code>proc_macro</code>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn"><code>syn</code></a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote"><code>quote</code></a>. The
<code>proc_macro</code> crate comes with Rust, so we didn’t need to add that to the
dependencies in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. The <code>proc_macro</code> crate is the compiler’s API that
allows us to read and manipulate Rust code from our code.</p>
<p>The <code>syn</code> crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure that we
can perform operations on. The <code>quote</code> crate turns <code>syn</code> data structures back
into Rust code. These crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust
code we might want to handle: writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple
task.</p>
<p>The <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function will be called when a user of our library
specifies <code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> on a type. This is possible because we’ve
annotated the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function here with <code>proc_macro_derive</code> and
specified the name <code>HelloMacro</code>, which matches our trait name; this is the
convention most procedural macros follow.</p>
<p>The <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function first converts the <code>input</code> from a
<code>TokenStream</code> to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform
operations on. This is where <code>syn</code> comes into play. The <code>parse</code> function in
<code>syn</code> takes a <code>TokenStream</code> and returns a <code>DeriveInput</code> struct representing the
parsed Rust code. Listing 19-32 shows the relevant parts of the <code>DeriveInput</code>
struct we get from parsing the <code>struct Pancakes;</code> string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">DeriveInput {
    // --snip--

    ident: Ident {
        ident: &quot;Pancakes&quot;,
        span: #0 bytes(95..103)
    },
    data: Struct(
        DataStruct {
            struct_token: Struct,
            fields: Unit,
            semi_token: Some(
                Semi
            )
        }
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-32: The <code>DeriveInput</code> instance we get when
parsing the code that has the macro’s attribute in Listing 19-30</span></p>
<p>The fields of this struct show that the Rust code we’ve parsed is a unit struct
with the <code>ident</code> (identifier, meaning the name) of <code>Pancakes</code>. There are more
fields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the <a href="https://docs.rs/syn/1.0/syn/struct.DeriveInput.html"><code>syn</code>
documentation for <code>DeriveInput</code></a> for more information.</p>
<p>Soon we’ll define the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function, which is where we’ll build
the new Rust code we want to include. But before we do, note that the output
for our derive macro is also a <code>TokenStream</code>. The returned <code>TokenStream</code> is
added to the code that our crate users write, so when they compile their crate,
they’ll get the extra functionality that we provide in the modified
<code>TokenStream</code>.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that we’re calling <code>unwrap</code> to cause the
<code>hello_macro_derive</code> function to panic if the call to the <code>syn::parse</code> function
fails here. It’s necessary for our procedural macro to panic on errors because
<code>proc_macro_derive</code> functions must return <code>TokenStream</code> rather than <code>Result</code> to
conform to the procedural macro API. We’ve simplified this example by using
<code>unwrap</code>; in production code, you should provide more specific error messages
about what went wrong by using <code>panic!</code> or <code>expect</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a <code>TokenStream</code>
into a <code>DeriveInput</code> instance, let’s generate the code that implements the
<code>HelloMacro</code> trait on the annotated type, as shown in Listing 19-33.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-33: Implementing the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait using
the parsed Rust code</span></p>
<p>We get an <code>Ident</code> struct instance containing the name (identifier) of the
annotated type using <code>ast.ident</code>. The struct in Listing 19-32 shows that when
we run the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function on the code in Listing 19-30, the
<code>ident</code> we get will have the <code>ident</code> field with a value of <code>&quot;Pancakes&quot;</code>. Thus,
the <code>name</code> variable in Listing 19-33 will contain an <code>Ident</code> struct instance
that, when printed, will be the string <code>&quot;Pancakes&quot;</code>, the name of the struct in
Listing 19-30.</p>
<p>The <code>quote!</code> macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return. The
compiler expects something different to the direct result of the <code>quote!</code>
macro’s execution, so we need to convert it to a <code>TokenStream</code>. We do this by
calling the <code>into</code> method, which consumes this intermediate representation and
returns a value of the required <code>TokenStream</code> type.</p>
<p>The <code>quote!</code> macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: we can
enter <code>#name</code>, and <code>quote!</code> will replace it with the value in the variable
<code>name</code>. You can even do some repetition similar to the way regular macros work.
Check out <a href="https://docs.rs/quote">the <code>quote</code> crate’s docs</a> for a thorough introduction.</p>
<p>We want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our <code>HelloMacro</code>
trait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by using <code>#name</code>. The
trait implementation has the one function <code>hello_macro</code>, whose body contains the
functionality we want to provide: printing <code>Hello, Macro! My name is</code> and then
the name of the annotated type.</p>
<p>The <code>stringify!</code> macro used here is built into Rust. It takes a Rust
expression, such as <code>1 + 2</code>, and at compile time turns the expression into a
string literal, such as <code>&quot;1 + 2&quot;</code>. This is different than <code>format!</code> or
<code>println!</code>, macros which evaluate the expression and then turn the result into
a <code>String</code>. There is a possibility that the <code>#name</code> input might be an
expression to print literally, so we use <code>stringify!</code>. Using <code>stringify!</code> also
saves an allocation by converting <code>#name</code> to a string literal at compile time.</p>
<p>At this point, <code>cargo build</code> should complete successfully in both <code>hello_macro</code>
and <code>hello_macro_derive</code>. Let’s hook up these crates to the code in Listing
19-30 to see the procedural macro in action! Create a new binary project in
your <em>projects</em> directory using <code>cargo new pancakes</code>. We need to add
<code>hello_macro</code> and <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as dependencies in the <code>pancakes</code>
crate’s <em>Cargo.toml</em>. If you’re publishing your versions of <code>hello_macro</code> and
<code>hello_macro_derive</code> to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, they would be regular
dependencies; if not, you can specify them as <code>path</code> dependencies as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">hello_macro = { path = &quot;../hello_macro&quot; }
hello_macro_derive = { path = &quot;../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Put the code in Listing 19-30 into <em>src/main.rs</em>, and run <code>cargo run</code>: it
should print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!</code> The implementation of the
<code>HelloMacro</code> trait from the procedural macro was included without the
<code>pancakes</code> crate needing to implement it; the <code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> added the
trait implementation.</p>
<p>Next, let’s explore how the other kinds of procedural macros differ from custom
derive macros.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-like-macros"><a class="header" href="#attribute-like-macros">Attribute-like macros</a></h3>
<p>Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of
generating code for the <code>derive</code> attribute, they allow you to create new
attributes. They’re also more flexible: <code>derive</code> only works for structs and
enums; attributes can be applied to other items as well, such as functions.
Here’s an example of using an attribute-like macro: say you have an attribute
named <code>route</code> that annotates functions when using a web application framework:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[route(GET, &quot;/&quot;)]
fn index() {
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>#[route]</code> attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural
macro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we have two parameters of type <code>TokenStream</code>. The first is for the
contents of the attribute: the <code>GET, &quot;/&quot;</code> part. The second is the body of the
item the attribute is attached to: in this case, <code>fn index() {}</code> and the rest
of the function’s body.</p>
<p>Other than that, attribute-like macros work the same way as custom derive
macros: you create a crate with the <code>proc-macro</code> crate type and implement a
function that generates the code you want!</p>
<h3 id="function-like-macros"><a class="header" href="#function-like-macros">Function-like macros</a></h3>
<p>Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls. Similarly to
<code>macro_rules!</code> macros, they’re more flexible than functions; for example, they
can take an unknown number of arguments. However, <code>macro_rules!</code> macros can be
defined only using the match-like syntax we discussed in the section
<a href="ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">“Declarative Macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> for General
Metaprogramming”</a><!-- ignore --> earlier. Function-like macros take a
<code>TokenStream</code> parameter and their definition manipulates that <code>TokenStream</code>
using Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do. An example of a
function-like macro is an <code>sql!</code> macro that might be called like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);
</code></pre>
<p>This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it’s
syntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a
<code>macro_rules!</code> macro can do. The <code>sql!</code> macro would be defined like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[proc_macro]
pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
</code></pre>
<p>This definition is similar to the custom derive macro’s signature: we receive
the tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code we wanted to
generate.</p>
<h2 id="summary-19"><a class="header" href="#summary-19">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Whew! Now you have some Rust features in your toolbox that you likely won’t use
often, but you’ll know they’re available in very particular circumstances.
We’ve introduced several complex topics so that when you encounter them in
error message suggestions or in other peoples’ code, you’ll be able to
recognize these concepts and syntax. Use this chapter as a reference to guide
you to solutions.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll put everything we’ve discussed throughout the book into practice
and do one more project!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="final-project-building-a-multithreaded-web-server"><a class="header" href="#final-project-building-a-multithreaded-web-server">Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server</a></h1>
<p>It’s been a long journey, but we’ve reached the end of the book. In this
chapter, we’ll build one more project together to demonstrate some of the
concepts we covered in the final chapters, as well as recap some earlier
lessons.</p>
<p>For our final project, we’ll make a web server that says “hello” and looks like
Figure 20-1 in a web browser.</p>
<p><img src="img/trpl20-01.png" alt="hello from rust" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 20-1: Our final shared project</span></p>
<p>Here is our plan for building the web server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.</li>
<li>Listen for TCP connections on a socket.</li>
<li>Parse a small number of HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Create a proper HTTP response.</li>
<li>Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we get started, we should mention one detail: the method we’ll use won’t
be the best way to build a web server with Rust. Community members have
published a number of production-ready crates available on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> that provide more complete web server and
thread pool implementations than we’ll build. However, our intention in this
chapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy route. Because Rust is a
systems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want to
work with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in other
languages. We’ll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually
so you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might
use in the future.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="building-a-single-threaded-web-server"><a class="header" href="#building-a-single-threaded-web-server">Building a Single-Threaded Web Server</a></h2>
<p>We’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin,
let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web
servers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but
a brief overview will give you the information you need.</p>
<p>The two main protocols involved in web servers are <em>Hypertext Transfer
Protocol</em> <em>(HTTP)</em> and <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> <em>(TCP)</em>. Both protocols
are <em>request-response</em> protocols, meaning a <em>client</em> initiates requests and a
<em>server</em> listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The
contents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.</p>
<p>TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information
gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that information is.
HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and
responses. It’s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in
the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We’ll work with the
raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.</p>
<h3 id="listening-to-the-tcp-connection"><a class="header" href="#listening-to-the-tcp-connection">Listening to the TCP Connection</a></h3>
<p>Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that’s the first part
we’ll work on. The standard library offers a <code>std::net</code> module that lets us do
this. Let’s make a new project in the usual fashion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello
     Created binary (application) `hello` project
$ cd hello
</code></pre>
<p>Now enter the code in Listing 20-1 in <em>src/main.rs</em> to start. This code will
listen at the local address <code>127.0.0.1:7878</code> for incoming TCP streams. When it
gets an incoming stream, it will print <code>Connection established!</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run">use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:7878&quot;).unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        println!(&quot;Connection established!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-1: Listening for incoming streams and printing
a message when we receive a stream</span></p>
<p>Using <code>TcpListener</code>, we can listen for TCP connections at the address
<code>127.0.0.1:7878</code>. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address
representing your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn’t
represent the authors’ computer specifically), and <code>7878</code> is the port. We’ve
chosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn’t normally accepted on this port so
our server is unlikely to conflict with any other web server you might have
running on your machine, and 7878 is <em>rust</em> typed on a telephone.</p>
<p>The <code>bind</code> function in this scenario works like the <code>new</code> function in that it
will return a new <code>TcpListener</code> instance. The function is called <code>bind</code>
because, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as “binding
to a port.”</p>
<p>The <code>bind</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which indicates that it’s
possible for binding to fail. For example, connecting to port 80 requires
administrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on ports higher
than 1023), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without being an
administrator, binding wouldn’t work. Binding also wouldn’t work, for example,
if we ran two instances of our program and so had two programs listening to the
same port. Because we’re writing a basic server just for learning purposes, we
won’t worry about handling these kinds of errors; instead, we use <code>unwrap</code> to
stop the program if errors happen.</p>
<p>The <code>incoming</code> method on <code>TcpListener</code> returns an iterator that gives us a
sequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type <code>TcpStream</code>). A single
<em>stream</em> represents an open connection between the client and the server. A
<em>connection</em> is the name for the full request and response process in which a
client connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server
closes the connection. As such, we will read from the <code>TcpStream</code> to see what
the client sent and then write our response to the stream to send data back to
the client. Overall, this <code>for</code> loop will process each connection in turn and
produce a series of streams for us to handle.</p>
<p>For now, our handling of the stream consists of calling <code>unwrap</code> to terminate
our program if the stream has any errors; if there aren’t any errors, the
program prints a message. We’ll add more functionality for the success case in
the next listing. The reason we might receive errors from the <code>incoming</code> method
when a client connects to the server is that we’re not actually iterating over
connections. Instead, we’re iterating over <em>connection attempts</em>. The
connection might not be successful for a number of reasons, many of them
operating system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to
the number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection
attempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open
connections are closed.</p>
<p>Let’s try running this code! Invoke <code>cargo run</code> in the terminal and then load
<em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in a web browser. The browser should show an error message
like “Connection reset,” because the server isn’t currently sending back any
data. But when you look at your terminal, you should see several messages that
were printed when the browser connected to the server!</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">     Running `target/debug/hello`
Connection established!
Connection established!
Connection established!
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the
reason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a
request for other resources, like the <em>favicon.ico</em> icon that appears in the
browser tab.</p>
<p>It could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server multiple
times because the server isn’t responding with any data. When <code>stream</code> goes out
of scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as
part of the <code>drop</code> implementation. Browsers sometimes deal with closed
connections by retrying, because the problem might be temporary. The important
factor is that we’ve successfully gotten a handle to a TCP connection!</p>
<p>Remember to stop the program by pressing <span class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span>
when you’re done running a particular version of the code. Then restart the
program by invoking the <code>cargo run</code> command after you’ve made each set of code
changes to make sure you’re running the newest code.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-request"><a class="header" href="#reading-the-request">Reading the Request</a></h3>
<p>Let’s implement the functionality to read the request from the browser! To
separate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking some action
with the connection, we’ll start a new function for processing connections. In
this new <code>handle_connection</code> function, we’ll read data from the TCP stream and
print it so we can see the data being sent from the browser. Change the code to
look like Listing 20-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run">use std::{
    io::{prelude::*, BufReader},
    net::{TcpListener, TcpStream},
};

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:7878&quot;).unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&amp;mut stream);
    let http_request: Vec&lt;_&gt; = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    println!(&quot;Request: {:#?}&quot;, http_request);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-2: Reading from the <code>TcpStream</code> and printing
the data</span></p>
<p>We bring <code>std::io::prelude</code> and <code>std::io::BufReader</code> into scope to get access
to traits and types that let us read from and write to the stream. In the <code>for</code>
loop in the <code>main</code> function, instead of printing a message that says we made a
connection, we now call the new <code>handle_connection</code> function and pass the
<code>stream</code> to it.</p>
<p>In the <code>handle_connection</code> function, we create a new <code>BufReader</code> instance that
wraps a mutable reference to the <code>stream</code>. <code>BufReader</code> adds buffering by
managing calls to the <code>std::io::Read</code> trait methods for us.</p>
<p>We create a variable named <code>http_request</code> to collect the lines of the request
the browser sends to our server. We indicate that we want to collect these
lines in a vector by adding the <code>Vec&lt;_&gt;</code> type annotation.</p>
<p><code>BufReader</code> implements the <code>std::io::BufRead</code> trait, which provides the <code>lines</code>
method. The <code>lines</code> method returns an iterator of <code>Result&lt;String, std::io::Error&gt;</code> by splitting the stream of data whenever it sees a newline
byte. To get each <code>String</code>, we map and <code>unwrap</code> each <code>Result</code>. The <code>Result</code>
might be an error if the data isn’t valid UTF-8 or if there was a problem
reading from the stream. Again, a production program should handle these errors
more gracefully, but we’re choosing to stop the program in the error case for
simplicity.</p>
<p>The browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline
characters in a row, so to get one request from the stream, we take lines until
we get a line that is the empty string. Once we’ve collected the lines into the
vector, we’re printing them out using pretty debug formatting so we can take a
look at the instructions the web browser is sending to our server.</p>
<p>Let’s try this code! Start the program and make a request in a web browser
again. Note that we’ll still get an error page in the browser, but our
program’s output in the terminal will now look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

]
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output. Now that
we’re printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple connections
from one browser request by looking at the path after <code>GET</code> in the first line
of the request. If the repeated connections are all requesting <em>/</em>, we know the
browser is trying to fetch <em>/</em> repeatedly because it’s not getting a response
from our program.</p>
<p>Let’s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of
our program.</p>
<h3 id="a-closer-look-at-an-http-request"><a class="header" href="#a-closer-look-at-an-http-request">A Closer Look at an HTTP Request</a></h3>
<p>HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the <em>request line</em> that holds information about what the
client is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the <em>method</em>
being used, such as <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>, which describes how the client is making
this request. Our client used a <code>GET</code> request, which means it is asking for
information.</p>
<p>The next part of the request line is <em>/</em>, which indicates the <em>Uniform Resource
Identifier</em> <em>(URI)</em> the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite,
the same as a <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em> <em>(URL)</em>. The difference between URIs
and URLs isn’t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec
uses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.</p>
<p>The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line
ends in a <em>CRLF sequence</em>. (CRLF stands for <em>carriage return</em> and <em>line feed</em>,
which are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be
written as <code>\r\n</code>, where <code>\r</code> is a carriage return and <code>\n</code> is a line feed. The
CRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of the request data.
Note that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than <code>\r\n</code>.</p>
<p>Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far,
we see that <code>GET</code> is the method, <em>/</em> is the request URI, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the
version.</p>
<p>After the request line, the remaining lines starting from <code>Host:</code> onward are
headers. <code>GET</code> requests have no body.</p>
<p>Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different
address, such as <em>127.0.0.1:7878/test</em>, to see how the request data changes.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let’s send back some data!</p>
<h3 id="writing-a-response"><a class="header" href="#writing-a-response">Writing a Response</a></h3>
<p>We’re going to implement sending data in response to a client request.
Responses have the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is a <em>status line</em> that contains the HTTP version used in the
response, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the request, and
a reason phrase that provides a text description of the status code. After the
CRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the
response.</p>
<p>Here is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1, has a status code of
200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
</code></pre>
<p>The status code 200 is the standard success response. The text is a tiny
successful HTTP response. Let’s write this to the stream as our response to a
successful request! From the <code>handle_connection</code> function, remove the
<code>println!</code> that was printing the request data and replace it with the code in
Listing 20-3.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-3: Writing a tiny successful HTTP response to
the stream</span></p>
<p>The first new line defines the <code>response</code> variable that holds the success
message’s data. Then we call <code>as_bytes</code> on our <code>response</code> to convert the string
data to bytes. The <code>write_all</code> method on <code>stream</code> takes a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> and sends
those bytes directly down the connection. Because the <code>write_all</code> operation
could fail, we use <code>unwrap</code> on any error result as before. Again, in a real
application you would add error handling here.</p>
<p>With these changes, let’s run our code and make a request. We’re no longer
printing any data to the terminal, so we won’t see any output other than the
output from Cargo. When you load <em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in a web browser, you should
get a blank page instead of an error. You’ve just hand-coded receiving an HTTP
request and sending a response!</p>
<h3 id="returning-real-html"><a class="header" href="#returning-real-html">Returning Real HTML</a></h3>
<p>Let’s implement the functionality for returning more than a blank page. Create

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-5: Sending the contents of <em>hello.html</em> as the
body of the response</span></p>
<p>We’ve added <code>fs</code> to the <code>use</code> statement to bring the standard library’s
filesystem module into scope. The code for reading the contents of a file to a
string should look familiar; we used it in Chapter 12 when we read the contents
of a file for our I/O project in Listing 12-4.</p>
<p>Next, we use <code>format!</code> to add the file’s contents as the body of the success
response. To ensure a valid HTTP response, we add the <code>Content-Length</code> header
which is set to the size of our response body, in this case the size of
<code>hello.html</code>.</p>
<p>Run this code with <code>cargo run</code> and load <em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in your browser; you
should see your HTML rendered!</p>
<p>Currently, we’re ignoring the request data in <code>http_request</code> and just sending
back the contents of the HTML file unconditionally. That means if you try
requesting <em>127.0.0.1:7878/something-else</em> in your browser, you’ll still get
back this same HTML response. At the moment, our server is very limited and
does not do what most web servers do. We want to customize our responses
depending on the request and only send back the HTML file for a well-formed
request to <em>/</em>.</p>
<h3 id="validating-the-request-and-selectively-responding"><a class="header" href="#validating-the-request-and-selectively-responding">Validating the Request and Selectively Responding</a></h3>
<p>Right now, our web server will return the HTML in the file no matter what the
client requested. Let’s add functionality to check that the browser is
requesting <em>/</em> before returning the HTML file and return an error if the
browser requests anything else. For this we need to modify <code>handle_connection</code>,
as shown in Listing 20-6. This new code checks the content of the request
received against what we know a request for <em>/</em> looks like and adds <code>if</code> and
<code>else</code> blocks to treat requests differently.</p>

<p>We’re only going to be looking at the first line of the HTTP request, so rather
than reading the entire request into a vector, we’re calling <code>next</code> to get the
first item from the iterator. The first <code>unwrap</code> takes care of the <code>Option</code> and
stops the program if the iterator has no items. The second <code>unwrap</code> handles the
<code>Result</code> and has the same effect as the <code>unwrap</code> that was in the <code>map</code> added in
Listing 20-2.</p>
<p>Next, we check the <code>request_line</code> to see if it equals the request line of a GET
request to the <em>/</em> path. If it does, the <code>if</code> block returns the contents of our
HTML file.</p>
<p>If the <code>request_line</code> does <em>not</em> equal the GET request to the <em>/</em> path, it
means we’ve received some other request. We’ll add code to the <code>else</code> block in
a moment to respond to all other requests.</p>
<p>Run this code now and request <em>127.0.0.1:7878</em>; you should get the HTML in
<em>hello.html</em>. If you make any other request, such as
<em>127.0.0.1:7878/something-else</em>, you’ll get a connection error like those you
saw when running the code in Listing 20-1 and Listing 20-2.</p>
<p>Now let’s add the code in Listing 20-7 to the <code>else</code> block to return a response
with the status code 404, which signals that the content for the request was
not found. We’ll also return some HTML for a page to render in the browser
indicating the response to the end user.</p>

<p>At the moment the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks have a lot of repetition: they’re both
reading files and writing the contents of the files to the stream. The only
differences are the status line and the filename. Let’s make the code more
concise by pulling out those differences into separate <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> lines
that will assign the values of the status line and the filename to variables;
we can then use those variables unconditionally in the code to read the file
and write the response. Listing 20-9 shows the resulting code after replacing
the large <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-9: Refactoring the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to
contain only the code that differs between the two cases</span></p>
<p>Now the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks only return the appropriate values for the
status line and filename in a tuple; we then use destructuring to assign these
two values to <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> using a pattern in the <code>let</code>
statement, as discussed in Chapter 18.</p>
<p>The previously duplicated code is now outside the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks and
uses the <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> variables. This makes it easier to see
the difference between the two cases, and it means we have only one place to
update the code if we want to change how the file reading and response writing
work. The behavior of the code in Listing 20-9 will be the same as that in
Listing 20-8.</p>
<p>Awesome! We now have a simple web server in approximately 40 lines of Rust code
that responds to one request with a page of content and responds to all other
requests with a 404 response.</p>
<p>Currently, our server runs in a single thread, meaning it can only serve one
request at a time. Let’s examine how that can be a problem by simulating some
slow requests. Then we’ll fix it so our server can handle multiple requests at
once.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="turning-our-single-threaded-server-into-a-multithreaded-server"><a class="header" href="#turning-our-single-threaded-server-into-a-multithreaded-server">Turning Our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server</a></h2>
<p>Right now, the server will process each request in turn, meaning it won’t
process a second connection until the first is finished processing. If the
server received more and more requests, this serial execution would be less and
less optimal. If the server receives a request that takes a long time to
process, subsequent requests will have to wait until the long request is
finished, even if the new requests can be processed quickly. We’ll need to fix
this, but first, we’ll look at the problem in action.</p>

<p>We’ll look at how a slow-processing request can affect other requests made to
our current server implementation. Listing 20-10 implements handling a request
to <em>/sleep</em> with a simulated slow response that will cause the server to sleep
for 5 seconds before responding.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-10: Simulating a slow request by sleeping for
5 seconds</span></p>
<p>We switched from <code>if</code> to <code>match</code> now that we have three cases. We need to
explicitly match on a slice of <code>request_line</code> to pattern match against the
string literal values; <code>match</code> doesn’t do automatic referencing and
dereferencing like the equality method does.</p>
<p>The first arm is the same as the <code>if</code> block from Listing 20-9. The second arm
matches a request to <em>/sleep</em>. When that request is received, the server will
sleep for 5 seconds before rendering the successful HTML page. The third arm is
the same as the <code>else</code> block from Listing 20-9.</p>
<p>You can see how primitive our server is: real libraries would handle the
recognition of multiple requests in a much less verbose way!</p>
<p>Start the server using <code>cargo run</code>. Then open two browser windows: one for
<em>http://127.0.0.1:7878/</em> and the other for <em>http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep</em>. If
you enter the <em>/</em> URI a few times, as before, you’ll see it respond quickly.
But if you enter <em>/sleep</em> and then load <em>/</em>, you’ll see that <em>/</em> waits until
<code>sleep</code> has slept for its full 5 seconds before loading.</p>
<p>There are multiple techniques we could use to avoid requests backing up behind
a slow request; the one we’ll implement is a thread pool.</p>
<h3 id="improving-throughput-with-a-thread-pool"><a class="header" href="#improving-throughput-with-a-thread-pool">Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool</a></h3>
<p>A <em>thread pool</em> is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready to
handle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the
threads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The
remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come
in while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done
processing its task, it’s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle
a new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,
increasing the throughput of your server.</p>
<p>We’ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to protect us
from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program create a new thread
for each request as it came in, someone making 10 million requests to our
server could create havoc by using up all our server’s resources and grinding
the processing of requests to a halt.</p>
<p>Rather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we’ll have a fixed number of
threads waiting in the pool. Requests that come in are sent to the pool for
processing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the
threads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request,
and then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process up
to <code>N</code> requests concurrently, where <code>N</code> is the number of threads. If each
thread is responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still
back up in the queue, but we’ve increased the number of long-running requests
we can handle before reaching that point.</p>
<p>This technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a web
server. Other options you might explore are the <em>fork/join model</em>, the
<em>single-threaded async I/O model</em>, or the <em>multi-threaded async I/O model</em>. If
you’re interested in this topic, you can read more about other solutions and
try to implement them; with a low-level language like Rust, all of these
options are possible.</p>
<p>Before we begin implementing a thread pool, let’s talk about what using the
pool should look like. When you’re trying to design code, writing the client
interface first can help guide your design. Write the API of the code so it’s
structured in the way you want to call it; then implement the functionality
within that structure rather than implementing the functionality and then
designing the public API.</p>
<p>Similar to how we used test-driven development in the project in Chapter 12,
we’ll use compiler-driven development here. We’ll write the code that calls the
functions we want, and then we’ll look at errors from the compiler to determine
what we should change next to get the code to work. Before we do that, however,
we’ll explore the technique we’re not going to use as a starting point.</p>

<h4 id="spawning-a-thread-for-each-request"><a class="header" href="#spawning-a-thread-for-each-request">Spawning a Thread for Each Request</a></h4>
<p>First, let’s explore how our code might look if it did create a new thread for
every connection. As mentioned earlier, this isn’t our final plan due to the
problems with potentially spawning an unlimited number of threads, but it is a
starting point to get a working multithreaded server first. Then we’ll add the
thread pool as an improvement, and contrasting the two solutions will be
easier. Listing 20-11 shows the changes to make to <code>main</code> to spawn a new thread
to handle each stream within the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Great! This error tells us we need a <code>ThreadPool</code> type or module, so we’ll
build one now. Our <code>ThreadPool</code> implementation will be independent of the kind
of work our web server is doing. So, let’s switch the <code>hello</code> crate from a

we change to a library crate, we could also use the separate thread pool
library for any work we want to do using a thread pool, not just for serving

<p>This code still won’t work, but let’s check it again to get the next error that
we need to address:</p>

error: could not compile `hello` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>This error indicates that next we need to create an associated function named
<code>new</code> for <code>ThreadPool</code>. We also know that <code>new</code> needs to have one parameter
that can accept <code>4</code> as an argument and should return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance.
Let’s implement the simplest <code>new</code> function that will have those
characteristics:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub struct ThreadPool;

impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {
        ThreadPool
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We chose <code>usize</code> as the type of the <code>size</code> parameter, because we know that a
negative number of threads doesn’t make any sense. We also know we’ll use this
4 as the number of elements in a collection of threads, which is what the
<code>usize</code> type is for, as discussed in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types">“Integer Types”</a><!--
ignore --> section of Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Let’s check the code again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0599]: no method named `execute` found for struct `ThreadPool` in the current scope

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.
error: could not compile `hello` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Now the error occurs because we don’t have an <code>execute</code> method on <code>ThreadPool</code>.
Recall from the <a href="ch20-02-multithreaded.html#creating-a-finite-number-of-threads">“Creating a Finite Number of
Threads”</a><!-- ignore --> section that we
decided our thread pool should have an interface similar to <code>thread::spawn</code>. In
addition, we’ll implement the <code>execute</code> function so it takes the closure it’s
given and gives it to an idle thread in the pool to run.</p>
<p>We’ll define the <code>execute</code> method on <code>ThreadPool</code> to take a closure as a
parameter. Recall from the <a href="ch13-01-closures.html#moving-captured-values-out-of-the-closure-and-the-fn-traits">“Moving Captured Values Out of the Closure and the
<code>Fn</code> Traits”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 13 that we can take
closures as parameters with three different traits: <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and
<code>FnOnce</code>. We need to decide which kind of closure to use here. We know we’ll
end up doing something similar to the standard library <code>thread::spawn</code>
implementation, so we can look at what bounds the signature of <code>thread::spawn</code>
has on its parameter. The documentation shows us the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,
        F: Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static,
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>F</code> type parameter is the one we’re concerned with here; the <code>T</code> type
parameter is related to the return value, and we’re not concerned with that. We
can see that <code>spawn</code> uses <code>FnOnce</code> as the trait bound on <code>F</code>. This is probably
what we want as well, because we’ll eventually pass the argument we get in
<code>execute</code> to <code>spawn</code>. We can be further confident that <code>FnOnce</code> is the trait we
want to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that
request’s closure one time, which matches the <code>Once</code> in <code>FnOnce</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>F</code> type parameter also has the trait bound <code>Send</code> and the lifetime bound
<code>'static</code>, which are useful in our situation: we need <code>Send</code> to transfer the
closure from one thread to another and <code>'static</code> because we don’t know how long
the thread will take to execute. Let’s create an <code>execute</code> method on
<code>ThreadPool</code> that will take a generic parameter of type <code>F</code> with these bounds:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground"><span class="boring">pub struct ThreadPool;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    pub fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {
</span><span class="boring">        ThreadPool
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    pub fn execute&lt;F&gt;(&amp;self, f: F)
    where
        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We still use the <code>()</code> after <code>FnOnce</code> because this <code>FnOnce</code> represents a closure
that takes no parameters and returns the unit type <code>()</code>. Just like function
definitions, the return type can be omitted from the signature, but even if we
have no parameters, we still need the parentheses.</p>
<p>Again, this is the simplest implementation of the <code>execute</code> method: it does
nothing, but we’re trying only to make our code compile. Let’s check it again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.24s
</code></pre>
<p>It compiles! But note that if you try <code>cargo run</code> and make a request in the
browser, you’ll see the errors in the browser that we saw at the beginning of
the chapter. Our library isn’t actually calling the closure passed to <code>execute</code>
yet!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: A saying you might hear about languages with strict compilers, such as
Haskell and Rust, is “if the code compiles, it works.” But this saying is not
universally true. Our project compiles, but it does absolutely nothing! If we
were building a real, complete project, this would be a good time to start
writing unit tests to check that the code compiles <em>and</em> has the behavior we
want.</p>

<h4 id="validating-the-number-of-threads-in-new"><a class="header" href="#validating-the-number-of-threads-in-new">Validating the Number of Threads in <code>new</code></a></h4>
<p>We aren’t doing anything with the parameters to <code>new</code> and <code>execute</code>. Let’s
implement the bodies of these functions with the behavior we want. To start,
let’s think about <code>new</code>. Earlier we chose an unsigned type for the <code>size</code>
parameter, because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense.
However, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly
valid <code>usize</code>. We’ll add code to check that <code>size</code> is greater than zero before
we return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance and have the program panic if it receives a
zero by using the <code>assert!</code> macro, as shown in Listing 20-13.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

    pub fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {
        assert!(size &gt; 0);

        ThreadPool
    }

    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    pub fn execute&lt;F&gt;(&amp;self, f: F)

</span><span class="boring">    }
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-13: Implementing <code>ThreadPool::new</code> to panic if
<code>size</code> is zero</span></p>
<p>We’ve also added some documentation for our <code>ThreadPool</code> with doc comments.
Note that we followed good documentation practices by adding a section that
calls out the situations in which our function can panic, as discussed in
Chapter 14. Try running <code>cargo doc --open</code> and clicking the <code>ThreadPool</code> struct
to see what the generated docs for <code>new</code> look like!</p>
<p>Instead of adding the <code>assert!</code> macro as we’ve done here, we could change <code>new</code>
into <code>build</code> and return a <code>Result</code> like we did with <code>Config::build</code> in the I/O
project in Listing 12-9. But we’ve decided in this case that trying to create a
thread pool without any threads should be an unrecoverable error. If you’re
feeling ambitious, try to write a function named <code>build</code> with the following
signature to compare with the <code>new</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn build(size: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;ThreadPool, PoolCreationError&gt; {
</code></pre>
<h4 id="creating-space-to-store-the-threads"><a class="header" href="#creating-space-to-store-the-threads">Creating Space to Store the Threads</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have a way to know we have a valid number of threads to store in
the pool, we can create those threads and store them in the <code>ThreadPool</code> struct
before returning the struct. But how do we “store” a thread? Let’s take another
look at the <code>thread::spawn</code> signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,
        F: Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static,
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>spawn</code> function returns a <code>JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type that the
closure returns. Let’s try using <code>JoinHandle</code> too and see what happens. In our
case, the closures we’re passing to the thread pool will handle the connection
and not return anything, so <code>T</code> will be the unit type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 20-14 will compile but doesn’t create any threads yet.
We’ve changed the definition of <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold a vector of
<code>thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instances, initialized the vector with a capacity of
<code>size</code>, set up a <code>for</code> loop that will run some code to create the threads, and
returned a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance containing them.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-14: Creating a vector for <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold

<p>We’ve brought <code>std::thread</code> into scope in the library crate, because we’re
using <code>thread::JoinHandle</code> as the type of the items in the vector in
<code>ThreadPool</code>.</p>
<p>Once a valid size is received, our <code>ThreadPool</code> creates a new vector that can
hold <code>size</code> items. The <code>with_capacity</code> function performs the same task as
<code>Vec::new</code> but with an important difference: it preallocates space in the
vector. Because we know we need to store <code>size</code> elements in the vector, doing
this allocation up front is slightly more efficient than using <code>Vec::new</code>,
which resizes itself as elements are inserted.</p>

<h4 id="a-worker-struct-responsible-for-sending-code-from-the-threadpool-to-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#a-worker-struct-responsible-for-sending-code-from-the-threadpool-to-a-thread">A <code>Worker</code> Struct Responsible for Sending Code from the <code>ThreadPool</code> to a Thread</a></h4>
<p>We left a comment in the <code>for</code> loop in Listing 20-14 regarding the creation of
threads. Here, we’ll look at how we actually create threads. The standard
library provides <code>thread::spawn</code> as a way to create threads, and
<code>thread::spawn</code> expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the
thread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have
them <em>wait</em> for code that we’ll send later. The standard library’s
implementation of threads doesn’t include any way to do that; we have to
implement it manually.</p>
<p>We’ll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure between the
<code>ThreadPool</code> and the threads that will manage this new behavior. We’ll call
this data structure <em>Worker</em>, which is a common term in pooling
implementations. The Worker picks up code that needs to be run and runs the
code in the Worker’s thread. Think of people working in the kitchen at a
restaurant: the workers wait until orders come in from customers, and then
they’re responsible for taking those orders and fulfilling them.</p>
<p>Instead of storing a vector of <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instances in the thread pool,
we’ll store instances of the <code>Worker</code> struct. Each <code>Worker</code> will store a single
<code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instance. Then we’ll implement a method on <code>Worker</code> that will
take a closure of code to run and send it to the already running thread for
execution. We’ll also give each worker an <code>id</code> so we can distinguish between
the different workers in the pool when logging or debugging.</p>
<p>Here is the new process that will happen when we create a <code>ThreadPool</code>. We’ll
implement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we have <code>Worker</code>
set up in this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a <code>Worker</code> struct that holds an <code>id</code> and a <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Change <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold a vector of <code>Worker</code> instances.</li>
<li>Define a <code>Worker::new</code> function that takes an <code>id</code> number and returns a
<code>Worker</code> instance that holds the <code>id</code> and a thread spawned with an empty
closure.</li>
<li>In <code>ThreadPool::new</code>, use the <code>for</code> loop counter to generate an <code>id</code>, create
a new <code>Worker</code> with that <code>id</code>, and store the worker in the vector.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before
looking at the code in Listing 20-15.</p>

instances instead of holding threads directly</span></p>
<p>We’ve changed the name of the field on <code>ThreadPool</code> from <code>threads</code> to <code>workers</code>
because it’s now holding <code>Worker</code> instances instead of <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>
instances. We use the counter in the <code>for</code> loop as an argument to
<code>Worker::new</code>, and we store each new <code>Worker</code> in the vector named <code>workers</code>.</p>
<p>External code (like our server in <em>src/main.rs</em>) doesn’t need to know the
implementation details regarding using a <code>Worker</code> struct within <code>ThreadPool</code>,
so we make the <code>Worker</code> struct and its <code>new</code> function private. The
<code>Worker::new</code> function uses the <code>id</code> we give it and stores a <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>
instance that is created by spawning a new thread using an empty closure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If the operating system can’t create a thread because there aren’t
enough system resources, <code>thread::spawn</code> will panic. That will cause our
whole server to panic, even though the creation of some threads might
succeed. For simplicity’s sake, this behavior is fine, but in a production
thread pool implementation, you’d likely want to use
<a href="../std/thread/struct.Builder.html"><code>std::thread::Builder</code></a><!-- ignore --> and its
<a href="../std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn"><code>spawn</code></a><!-- ignore --> method that returns <code>Result</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code will compile and will store the number of <code>Worker</code> instances we
specified as an argument to <code>ThreadPool::new</code>. But we’re <em>still</em> not processing
the closure that we get in <code>execute</code>. Let’s look at how to do that next.</p>
<h4 id="sending-requests-to-threads-via-channels"><a class="header" href="#sending-requests-to-threads-via-channels">Sending Requests to Threads via Channels</a></h4>
<p>The next problem we’ll tackle is that the closures given to <code>thread::spawn</code> do
absolutely nothing. Currently, we get the closure we want to execute in the
<code>execute</code> method. But we need to give <code>thread::spawn</code> a closure to run when we
create each <code>Worker</code> during the creation of the <code>ThreadPool</code>.</p>
<p>We want the <code>Worker</code> structs that we just created to fetch the code to run from
a queue held in the <code>ThreadPool</code> and send that code to its thread to run.</p>
<p>The channels we learned about in Chapter 16—a simple way to communicate between
two threads—would be perfect for this use case. We’ll use a channel to function
as the queue of jobs, and <code>execute</code> will send a job from the <code>ThreadPool</code> to
the <code>Worker</code> instances, which will send the job to its thread. Here is the plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>ThreadPool</code> will create a channel and hold on to the sender.</li>
<li>Each <code>Worker</code> will hold on to the receiver.</li>
<li>We’ll create a new <code>Job</code> struct that will hold the closures we want to send
down the channel.</li>
<li>The <code>execute</code> method will send the job it wants to execute through the
sender.</li>
<li>In its thread, the <code>Worker</code> will loop over its receiver and execute the
closures of any jobs it receives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start by creating a channel in <code>ThreadPool::new</code> and holding the sender
in the <code>ThreadPool</code> instance, as shown in Listing 20-16. The <code>Job</code> struct
doesn’t hold anything for now but will be the type of item we’re sending down
the channel.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The code is trying to pass <code>receiver</code> to multiple <code>Worker</code> instances. This
won’t work, as you’ll recall from Chapter 16: the channel implementation that
Rust provides is multiple <em>producer</em>, single <em>consumer</em>. This means we can’t
just clone the consuming end of the channel to fix this code. We also don’t
want to send a message multiple times to multiple consumers; we want one list
of messages with multiple workers such that each message gets processed once.</p>
<p>Additionally, taking a job off the channel queue involves mutating the
<code>receiver</code>, so the threads need a safe way to share and modify <code>receiver</code>;
otherwise, we might get race conditions (as covered in Chapter 16).</p>
<p>Recall the thread-safe smart pointers discussed in Chapter 16: to share
ownership across multiple threads and allow the threads to mutate the value, we
need to use <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>Arc</code> type will let multiple workers own the
receiver, and <code>Mutex</code> will ensure that only one worker gets a job from the
receiver at a time. Listing 20-18 shows the changes we need to make.</p>

<p>After creating a new <code>Job</code> instance using the closure we get in <code>execute</code>, we
send that job down the sending end of the channel. We’re calling <code>unwrap</code> on
<code>send</code> for the case that sending fails. This might happen if, for example, we
stop all our threads from executing, meaning the receiving end has stopped
receiving new messages. At the moment, we can’t stop our threads from
executing: our threads continue executing as long as the pool exists. The
reason we use <code>unwrap</code> is that we know the failure case won’t happen, but the
compiler doesn’t know that.</p>
<p>But we’re not quite done yet! In the worker, our closure being passed to
<code>thread::spawn</code> still only <em>references</em> the receiving end of the channel.
Instead, we need the closure to loop forever, asking the receiving end of the
channel for a job and running the job when it gets one. Let’s make the change

<p>Here, we first call <code>lock</code> on the <code>receiver</code> to acquire the mutex, and then we
call <code>unwrap</code> to panic on any errors. Acquiring a lock might fail if the mutex
is in a <em>poisoned</em> state, which can happen if some other thread panicked while
holding the lock rather than releasing the lock. In this situation, calling
<code>unwrap</code> to have this thread panic is the correct action to take. Feel free to
change this <code>unwrap</code> to an <code>expect</code> with an error message that is meaningful to
you.</p>
<p>If we get the lock on the mutex, we call <code>recv</code> to receive a <code>Job</code> from the
channel. A final <code>unwrap</code> moves past any errors here as well, which might occur
if the thread holding the sender has shut down, similar to how the <code>send</code>
method returns <code>Err</code> if the receiver shuts down.</p>
<p>The call to <code>recv</code> blocks, so if there is no job yet, the current thread will
wait until a job becomes available. The <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> ensures that only one
<code>Worker</code> thread at a time is trying to request a job.</p>
<p>Our thread pool is now in a working state! Give it a <code>cargo run</code> and make some
requests:</p>

<p>Success! We now have a thread pool that executes connections asynchronously.
There are never more than four threads created, so our system won’t get
overloaded if the server receives a lot of requests. If we make a request to
<em>/sleep</em>, the server will be able to serve other requests by having another
thread run them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: if you open <em>/sleep</em> in multiple browser windows simultaneously, they
might load one at a time in 5 second intervals. Some web browsers execute
multiple instances of the same request sequentially for caching reasons. This
limitation is not caused by our web server.</p>

why we didn’t write the worker thread code as shown in Listing 20-21.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-21: An alternative implementation of
<code>Worker::new</code> using <code>while let</code></span></p>
<p>This code compiles and runs but doesn’t result in the desired threading
behavior: a slow request will still cause other requests to wait to be
processed. The reason is somewhat subtle: the <code>Mutex</code> struct has no public
<code>unlock</code> method because the ownership of the lock is based on the lifetime of
the <code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code> within the <code>LockResult&lt;MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> that the <code>lock</code>
method returns. At compile time, the borrow checker can then enforce the rule
that a resource guarded by a <code>Mutex</code> cannot be accessed unless we hold the
lock. However, this implementation can also result in the lock being held
longer than intended if we aren’t mindful of the lifetime of the
<code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 20-20 that uses <code>let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();</code> works because with <code>let</code>, any
temporary values used in the expression on the right hand side of the equals
sign are immediately dropped when the <code>let</code> statement ends. However, <code>while let</code> (and <code>if let</code> and <code>match</code>) does not drop temporary values until the end of
the associated block. In Listing 20-21, the lock remains held for the duration
of the call to <code>job()</code>, meaning other workers cannot receive jobs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup"><a class="header" href="#graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup">Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup</a></h2>
<p>The code in Listing 20-20 is responding to requests asynchronously through the
use of a thread pool, as we intended. We get some warnings about the <code>workers</code>,
<code>id</code>, and <code>thread</code> fields that we’re not using in a direct way that reminds us
we’re not cleaning up anything. When we use the less elegant <span
class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span> method to halt the main thread, all other
threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they’re in the middle of
serving a request.</p>
<p>Next, then, we’ll implement the <code>Drop</code> trait to call <code>join</code> on each of the
threads in the pool so they can finish the requests they’re working on before
closing. Then we’ll implement a way to tell the threads they should stop
accepting new requests and shut down. To see this code in action, we’ll modify
our server to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down its
thread pool.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-the-drop-trait-on-threadpool"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-drop-trait-on-threadpool">Implementing the <code>Drop</code> Trait on <code>ThreadPool</code></a></h3>
<p>Let’s start with implementing <code>Drop</code> on our thread pool. When the pool is
dropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their work.
Listing 20-22 shows a first attempt at a <code>Drop</code> implementation; this code won’t
quite work yet.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-22: Joining each thread when the thread pool
goes out of scope</span></p>
<p>First, we loop through each of the thread pool <code>workers</code>. We use <code>&amp;mut</code> for
this because <code>self</code> is a mutable reference, and we also need to be able to
mutate <code>worker</code>. For each worker, we print a message saying that this
particular worker is shutting down, and then we call <code>join</code> on that worker’s
thread. If the call to <code>join</code> fails, we use <code>unwrap</code> to make Rust panic and go
into an ungraceful shutdown.</p>
<p>Here is the error we get when we compile this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `worker.thread` which is behind a mutable reference
    --&gt; src/lib.rs:52:13
     |
52   |             worker.thread.join().unwrap();
     |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `worker.thread` moved due to this method call
     |             |
     |             move occurs because `worker.thread` has type `JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
     |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `worker.thread`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0507`.
error: could not compile `hello` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The error tells us we can’t call <code>join</code> because we only have a mutable borrow
of each <code>worker</code> and <code>join</code> takes ownership of its argument. To solve this
issue, we need to move the thread out of the <code>Worker</code> instance that owns
<code>thread</code> so <code>join</code> can consume the thread. We did this in Listing 17-15: if
<code>Worker</code> holds an <code>Option&lt;thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;&gt;</code> instead, we can call the
<code>take</code> method on the <code>Option</code> to move the value out of the <code>Some</code> variant and
leave a <code>None</code> variant in its place. In other words, a <code>Worker</code> that is running
will have a <code>Some</code> variant in <code>thread</code>, and when we want to clean up a
<code>Worker</code>, we’ll replace <code>Some</code> with <code>None</code> so the <code>Worker</code> doesn’t have a
thread to run.</p>
<p>So we know we want to update the definition of <code>Worker</code> like this:</p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 17, the <code>take</code> method on <code>Option</code> takes the <code>Some</code>
variant out and leaves <code>None</code> in its place. We’re using <code>if let</code> to destructure
the <code>Some</code> and get the thread; then we call <code>join</code> on the thread. If a worker’s
thread is already <code>None</code>, we know that worker has already had its thread
cleaned up, so nothing happens in that case.</p>
<h3 id="signaling-to-the-threads-to-stop-listening-for-jobs"><a class="header" href="#signaling-to-the-threads-to-stop-listening-for-jobs">Signaling to the Threads to Stop Listening for Jobs</a></h3>
<p>With all the changes we’ve made, our code compiles without any warnings.
However, the bad news is this code doesn’t function the way we want it to yet.
The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the <code>Worker</code>
instances: at the moment, we call <code>join</code>, but that won’t shut down the threads
because they <code>loop</code> forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our
<code>ThreadPool</code> with our current implementation of <code>drop</code>, the main thread will
block forever waiting for the first thread to finish.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, we’ll need a change in the <code>ThreadPool</code> <code>drop</code>
implementation and then a change in the <code>Worker</code> loop.</p>
<p>First, we’ll change the <code>ThreadPool</code> <code>drop</code> implementation to explicitly drop
the <code>sender</code> before waiting for the threads to finish. Listing 20-23 shows the
changes to <code>ThreadPool</code> to explicitly drop <code>sender</code>. We use the same <code>Option</code>
and <code>take</code> technique as we did with the thread to be able to move <code>sender</code> out
of <code>ThreadPool</code>:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-25: Shut down the server after serving two
requests by exiting the loop</span></p>
<p>You wouldn’t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving only two
requests. This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is
in working order.</p>
<p>The <code>take</code> method is defined in the <code>Iterator</code> trait and limits the iteration
to the first two items at most. The <code>ThreadPool</code> will go out of scope at the
end of <code>main</code>, and the <code>drop</code> implementation will run.</p>
<p>Start the server with <code>cargo run</code>, and make three requests. The third request
should error, and in your terminal you should see output similar to this:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch20-web-server/listing-20-25
cargo run
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
third request will error because server will have shut down
copy output below
Can't automate because the output depends on making requests

<p>You might see a different ordering of workers and messages printed. We can see
how this code works from the messages: workers 0 and 3 got the first two
requests. The server stopped accepting connections after the second connection,
and the <code>Drop</code> implementation on <code>ThreadPool</code> starts executing before worker 3
even starts its job. Dropping the <code>sender</code> disconnects all the workers and
tells them to shut down. The workers each print a message when they disconnect,
and then the thread pool calls <code>join</code> to wait for each worker thread to finish.</p>
<p>Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: the <code>ThreadPool</code>
dropped the <code>sender</code>, and before any worker received an error, we tried to join
worker 0. Worker 0 had not yet gotten an error from <code>recv</code>, so the main thread
blocked waiting for worker 0 to finish. In the meantime, worker 3 received a
job and then all threads received an error. When worker 0 finished, the main
thread waited for the rest of the workers to finish. At that point, they had
all exited their loops and stopped.</p>
<p>Congrats! We’ve now completed our project; we have a basic web server that uses
a thread pool to respond asynchronously. We’re able to perform a graceful
shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.</p>

<p>We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are
some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more documentation to <code>ThreadPool</code> and its public methods.</li>
<li>Add tests of the library’s functionality.</li>
<li>Change calls to <code>unwrap</code> to more robust error handling.</li>
<li>Use <code>ThreadPool</code> to perform some task other than serving web requests.</li>
<li>Find a thread pool crate on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and implement a
similar web server using the crate instead. Then compare its API and
robustness to the thread pool we implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following list contains keywords that are reserved for current or future
use by the Rust language. As such, they cannot be used as identifiers (except
as raw identifiers as we’ll discuss in the “<a href="appendix-01-keywords.html#raw-identifiers">Raw
Identifiers</a><!-- ignore -->” section). Identifiers are names
of functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,
macros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes.</p>
<h3 id="keywords-currently-in-use"><a class="header" href="#keywords-currently-in-use">Keywords Currently in Use</a></h3>
<p>The following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality
described.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>as</code> - perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing
an item, or rename items in <code>use</code> statements</li>
<li><code>async</code> -  return a <code>Future</code> instead of blocking the current thread</li>
<li><code>await</code> - suspend execution until the result of a <code>Future</code> is ready</li>
<li><code>break</code> - exit a loop immediately</li>
<li><code>const</code> - define constant items or constant raw pointers</li>
<li><code>continue</code> - continue to the next loop iteration</li>
<li><code>crate</code> - in a module path, refers to the crate root</li>
<li><code>dyn</code> - dynamic dispatch to a trait object</li>
<li><code>else</code> - fallback for <code>if</code> and <code>if let</code> control flow constructs</li>
<li><code>enum</code> - define an enumeration</li>
<li><code>extern</code> - link an external function or variable</li>
<li><code>false</code> - Boolean false literal</li>
<li><code>fn</code> - define a function or the function pointer type</li>
<li><code>for</code> - loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a
higher-ranked lifetime</li>
<li><code>if</code> - branch based on the result of a conditional expression</li>
<li><code>impl</code> - implement inherent or trait functionality</li>
<li><code>in</code> - part of <code>for</code> loop syntax</li>
<li><code>let</code> - bind a variable</li>

<li><code>mod</code> - define a module</li>
<li><code>move</code> - make a closure take ownership of all its captures</li>
<li><code>mut</code> - denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings</li>
<li><code>pub</code> - denote public visibility in struct fields, <code>impl</code> blocks, or modules</li>
<li><code>ref</code> - bind by reference</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="keywords-reserved-for-future-use"><a class="header" href="#keywords-reserved-for-future-use">Keywords Reserved for Future Use</a></h3>
<p>The following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by
Rust for potential future use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>abstract</code></li>
<li><code>become</code></li>
<li><code>box</code></li>
<li><code>do</code></li>
<li><code>final</code></li>
<li><code>macro</code></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="raw-identifiers"><a class="header" href="#raw-identifiers">Raw Identifiers</a></h3>
<p><em>Raw identifiers</em> are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t
normally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with <code>r#</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>match</code> is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function
that uses <code>match</code> as its name:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">fn match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}
</code></pre>
<p>you’ll get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: expected identifier, found keyword `match`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:4
  |
4 | fn match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword
</code></pre>
<p>The error shows that you can’t use the keyword <code>match</code> as the function
identifier. To use <code>match</code> as a function name, you need to use the raw
identifier syntax, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn r#match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

fn main() {
    assert!(r#match(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;foobar&quot;));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will compile without any errors. Note the <code>r#</code> prefix on the function
name in its definition as well as where the function is called in <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if
that word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to
choose identifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in
a language where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers
allow you to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate
uses. For example, <code>try</code> isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018
edition. If you depend on a library that’s written using the 2015 edition and
has a <code>try</code> function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, <code>r#try</code> in
this case, to call that function from your 2018 edition code. See <a href="appendix-05-editions.html">Appendix
E</a><!-- ignore --> for more information on editions.</p>

<p>In various places in the book, we’ve discussed the <code>derive</code> attribute, which
you can apply to a struct or enum definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>derive</code> attribute generates
code that will implement a trait with its own default implementation on the
type you’ve annotated with the <code>derive</code> syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this appendix, we provide a reference of all the traits in the standard
library that you can use with <code>derive</code>. Each section covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What operators and methods deriving this trait will enable</li>
<li>What the implementation of the trait provided by <code>derive</code> does</li>
<li>What implementing the trait signifies about the type</li>
<li>The conditions in which you’re allowed or not allowed to implement the trait</li>
<li>Examples of operations that require the trait</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want different behavior from that provided by the <code>derive</code> attribute,
consult the <a href="../std/index.html">standard library documentation</a><!-- ignore -->
for each trait for details of how to manually implement them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These traits listed here are the only ones <strong>defined by the standard library</strong> that
can be implemented on your types using <code>derive</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other traits defined in the
standard library don’t have sensible default behavior, so it’s up to you to
implement them in the way that makes sense for what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a trait that can’t be derived is <code>Display</code>, which handles
formatting for end users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should always consider the appropriate way to
display a type to an end user:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What parts of the type should an end user be
allowed to see?</li>
<li>What parts would they find relevant?</li>
<li>What format of the data would be most relevant to them?</li>
<li>The Rust compiler doesn’t have this insight, so
it can’t provide appropriate default behavior for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of derivable traits provided in this appendix is not comprehensive:</p>
<ul>
<li>libraries can implement <code>derive</code> for their own traits, making the list of
traits you can use <code>derive</code> with truly open-ended.</li>
<li>Implementing <code>derive</code> involves using a procedural macro, which is covered in the
<a href="ch19-06-macros.html#macros">“Macros”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 19.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debug-for-programmer-output"><a class="header" href="#debug-for-programmer-output"><code>Debug</code> for Programmer Output</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> trait enables debug formatting in format strings, which you
indicate by adding <code>:?</code> within <code>{}</code> placeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> trait allows you to print instances of a type for debugging
purposes, so you and other programmers using your type can inspect an instance
at a particular point in a program’s execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> trait is required, for example, in use of the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This macro prints the values of instances given as arguments if the equality
assertion fails so programmers can see why the two instances weren’t equal.</li>

<h3 id="partialeq"><a class="header" href="#partialeq">PartialEq</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait allows you to compare instances of a type to check for
equality and enables use of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deriving <code>PartialEq</code> implements the <code>eq</code> method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When <code>PartialEq</code> is derived on
structs, two instances are equal only if <em>all</em> fields are equal, and the
instances are not equal if any fields are not equal.</li>
<li>When derived on enums,
each variant is equal to itself and not equal to the other variants.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait is required, for example, with the use of the
<code>assert_eq!</code> macro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a type
for equality.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="eq"><a class="header" href="#eq">Eq</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The <code>Eq</code> trait has no methods.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Its purpose is to signal that for every value of
the annotated type, the value is equal to itself.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>The <code>Eq</code> trait can only be
applied to types that also implement <code>PartialEq</code>, although not all types that
implement <code>PartialEq</code> can implement <code>Eq</code>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One example of this is floating point
number types: the implementation of floating point numbers states that two
instances of the not-a-number (<code>NaN</code>) value are not equal to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An example of when <code>Eq</code> is required is for keys in a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> so the
<code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> can tell whether two keys are the same.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons"><a class="header" href="#partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons"><code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Ord</code> for Ordering Comparisons</a></h2>
<h3 id="partialord"><a class="header" href="#partialord">PartialOrd</a></h3>
<p>The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait allows you to compare instances of a type for sorting
purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>A type that implements <code>PartialOrd</code> can be used with the <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> operators.</li>
<li>You can only apply the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait to types
that also implement <code>PartialEq</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deriving <code>PartialOrd</code> implements the <code>partial_cmp</code> method, which returns an
<code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> that will be <code>None</code> when the values given don’t produce an
ordering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of a value that doesn’t produce an ordering, even though
most values of that type can be compared, is the not-a-number (<code>NaN</code>) floating
point value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling <code>partial_cmp</code> with any floating point number and the <code>NaN</code>
floating point value will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>When derived on structs, <code>PartialOrd</code> compares two instances by comparing the
value in each field in the order in which the fields appear in the struct
definition.</p>
<p>When derived on enums, variants of the enum declared earlier in the
enum definition are considered less than the variants listed later.</p>
<p>The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait is required, for example, for the <code>gen_range</code> method
from the <code>rand</code> crate that generates a random value in the range specified by a
range expression.</p>
<h3 id="ord"><a class="header" href="#ord">Ord</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Ord</code> trait allows you to know that for any two values of the annotated
type, a valid ordering will exist.</p>
<p>The <code>Ord</code> trait implements the <code>cmp</code> method,
which returns an <code>Ordering</code> rather than an <code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> because a valid
ordering will always be possible.</p>
<p>You can only apply the <code>Ord</code> trait to types
that also implement <code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Eq</code> (and <code>Eq</code> requires <code>PartialEq</code>).</p>
<p>When
derived on structs and enums, <code>cmp</code> behaves the same way as the derived
implementation for <code>partial_cmp</code> does with <code>PartialOrd</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of when <code>Ord</code> is required is when storing values in a <code>BTreeSet&lt;T&gt;</code>,
a data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.</p>

<h2 id="clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values"><a class="header" href="#clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values"><code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code> for Duplicating Values</a></h2>
<h3 id="clone"><a class="header" href="#clone">Clone</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Clone</code> trait allows you to explicitly create <strong>a deep copy of a value</strong>, and
the duplication process might involve running arbitrary code and copying heap
data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone">“Ways Variables and Data Interact:
Clone”</a><!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 4 for more information on <code>Clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deriving <code>Clone</code> implements the <code>clone</code> method, which when implemented for the
whole type, calls <code>clone</code> on each of the parts of the type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means all the
fields or values in the type must also implement <code>Clone</code> to derive <code>Clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of when <code>Clone</code> is required is when calling the <code>to_vec</code> method on a
slice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slice doesn’t own the type instances it contains, but the vector
returned from <code>to_vec</code> will need to own its instances, so <code>to_vec</code> calls
<code>clone</code> on each item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement <code>Clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="copy"><a class="header" href="#copy">Copy</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits <strong>stored on
the stack</strong>; no arbitrary code is necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy">“Stack-Only Data:
Copy”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 for more
information on <code>Copy</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait doesn’t define any methods to prevent programmers from
overloading those methods and violating the assumption that no arbitrary code
is being run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That way, all programmers can assume that copying a value will be
very fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can derive <code>Copy</code> on any type whose parts all implement <code>Copy</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A type that
implements <code>Copy</code> must also implement <code>Clone</code>, because a type that implements
<code>Copy</code> has a trivial implementation of <code>Clone</code> that performs the same task as
<code>Copy</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait is rarely required;</p>
<p>types that implement <code>Copy</code> have
optimizations available, meaning you don’t have to call <code>clone</code>, which makes
the code more concise.</p>
<p>Everything possible with <code>Copy</code> you can also accomplish with <code>Clone</code>, but the
code might be slower or have to use <code>clone</code> in places.</p>

<p>The <code>Hash</code> trait allows you to take an instance of a type of arbitrary size and
map that instance to a value of fixed size using a hash function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deriving <code>Hash</code> implements the <code>hash</code> method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The derived implementation of the <code>hash</code>
method combines the result of calling <code>hash</code> on each of the parts of the type,
meaning all fields or values must also implement <code>Hash</code> to derive <code>Hash</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of when <code>Hash</code> is required is in storing keys in a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>
to store data efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="default-for-default-values"><a class="header" href="#default-for-default-values"><code>Default</code> for Default Values</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Default</code> trait allows you to create a default value for a type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deriving <code>Default</code> implements the <code>default</code> function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The derived implementation of the
<code>default</code> function calls the <code>default</code> function on each part of the type,
meaning all fields or values in the type must also implement <code>Default</code> to
derive <code>Default</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Default::default</code> function is commonly used in combination with the struct
update syntax discussed in the <a href="ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-instances-from-other-instances-with-struct-update-syntax">“Creating Instances From Other Instances With
Struct Update
Syntax”</a><!-- ignore -->
section in Chapter 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can customize a few fields of a struct and then
set and use a default value for the rest of the fields by using
<code>..Default::default()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Default</code> trait is required when you use the method <code>unwrap_or_default</code> on
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> instances, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>None</code>, the method
<code>unwrap_or_default</code> will return the result of <code>Default::default</code> for the type
<code>T</code> stored in the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="appendix-d---useful-development-tools"><a class="header" href="#appendix-d---useful-development-tools">Appendix D - Useful Development Tools</a></h2>
<p>In this appendix, we talk about some useful development tools that the Rust
project provides. We’ll look at automatic formatting, quick ways to apply
warning fixes, a linter, and integrating with IDEs.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-formatting-with-rustfmt"><a class="header" href="#automatic-formatting-with-rustfmt">Automatic Formatting with <code>rustfmt</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>rustfmt</code> tool reformats your code according to the community code style.
Many collaborative projects use <code>rustfmt</code> to prevent arguments about which
style to use when writing Rust: everyone formats their code using the tool.</p>
<p>To install <code>rustfmt</code>, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup component add rustfmt
</code></pre>
<p>This command gives you <code>rustfmt</code> and <code>cargo-fmt</code>, similar to how Rust gives you
both <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>. To format any Cargo project, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo fmt
</code></pre>
<p>Running this command reformats all the Rust code in the current crate. This
should only change the code style, not the code semantics. For more information
on <code>rustfmt</code>, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">its documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fix-your-code-with-rustfix"><a class="header" href="#fix-your-code-with-rustfix">Fix Your Code with <code>rustfix</code></a></h3>
<p>The rustfix tool is included with Rust installations and can automatically fix
compiler warnings that have a clear way to correct the problem that’s likely
what you want. It’s likely you’ve seen compiler warnings before. For example,
consider this code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we’re calling the <code>do_something</code> function 100 times, but we never use the
variable <code>i</code> in the body of the <code>for</code> loop. Rust warns us about that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
   Compiling myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
warning: unused variable: `i`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:9
  |
4 |     for i in 0..100 {
  |         ^ help: consider using `_i` instead
  |
  = note: #[warn(unused_variables)] on by default

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s
</code></pre>
<p>The warning suggests that we use <code>_i</code> as a name instead: the underscore
indicates that we intend for this variable to be unused. We can automatically
apply that suggestion using the <code>rustfix</code> tool by running the command <code>cargo fix</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo fix
    Checking myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
      Fixing src/main.rs (1 fix)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
</code></pre>
<p>When we look at <em>src/main.rs</em> again, we’ll see that <code>cargo fix</code> has changed the
code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for _i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop variable is now named <code>_i</code>, and the warning no longer appears.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>cargo fix</code> command to transition your code between
different Rust editions. Editions are covered in Appendix E.</p>
<h3 id="more-lints-with-clippy"><a class="header" href="#more-lints-with-clippy">More Lints with Clippy</a></h3>
<p>The Clippy tool is a collection of lints to analyze your code so you can catch
common mistakes and improve your Rust code.</p>
<p>To install Clippy, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup component add clippy
</code></pre>
<p>To run Clippy’s lints on any Cargo project, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo clippy
</code></pre>
<p>For example, say you write a program that uses an approximation of a
mathematical constant, such as pi, as this program does:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 3.1415;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!(&quot;the area of the circle is {}&quot;, x * r * r);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo clippy</code> on this project results in this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: approximate value of `f{32, 64}::consts::PI` found
 --&gt; src/main.rs:2:13
  |
2 |     let x = 3.1415;
  |             ^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[deny(clippy::approx_constant)]` on by default
  = help: consider using the constant directly
  = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#approx_constant
</code></pre>
<p>This error lets you know that Rust already has a more precise <code>PI</code> constant
defined, and that your program would be more correct if you used the constant
instead. You would then change your code to use the <code>PI</code> constant. The
following code doesn’t result in any errors or warnings from Clippy:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = std::f64::consts::PI;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!(&quot;the area of the circle is {}&quot;, x * r * r);
}
</code></pre></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="appendix-e---editions"><a class="header" href="#appendix-e---editions">Appendix E - Editions</a></h2>
<p>In Chapter 1, you saw that <code>cargo new</code> adds a bit of metadata to your
<em>Cargo.toml</em> file about an edition. This appendix talks about what that means!</p>
<p>The Rust language and compiler have a six-week release cycle, meaning users get
a constant stream of new features. Other programming languages release larger
changes less often; Rust releases smaller updates more frequently. After a
while, all of these tiny changes add up. But from release to release, it can be
difficult to look back and say, “Wow, between Rust 1.10 and Rust 1.31, Rust has
changed a lot!”</p>
<p>Every two or three years, the Rust team produces a new Rust <em>edition</em>. Each
edition brings together the features that have landed into a clear package with
fully updated documentation and tooling. New editions ship as part of the usual
six-week release process.</p>
<p>Editions serve different purposes for different people:</p>
<ul>
<li>For active Rust users, a new edition brings together incremental changes into
an easy-to-understand package.</li>
<li>For non-users, a new edition signals that some major advancements have
landed, which might make Rust worth another look.</li>
<li>For those developing Rust, a new edition provides a rallying point for the
project as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of this writing, three Rust editions are available: Rust 2015, Rust
2018, and Rust 2021. This book is written using Rust 2021 edition idioms.</p>
<p>The <code>edition</code> key in <em>Cargo.toml</em> indicates which edition the compiler should
use for your code. If the key doesn’t exist, Rust uses <code>2015</code> as the edition
value for backward compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>Each project can opt in to an edition other than the default 2015 edition.
Editions can contain incompatible changes, such as including a new keyword that
conflicts with identifiers in code. However, unless you opt in to those
changes, your code will continue to compile even as you upgrade the Rust
compiler version you use.</p>
<p>All Rust compiler versions support any edition that existed prior to that
compiler’s release, and they can link crates of any supported editions
together. Edition changes only affect the way the compiler initially parses
code. Therefore, if you’re using Rust 2015 and one of your dependencies uses
Rust 2018, your project will compile and be able to use that dependency. The
opposite situation, where your project uses Rust 2018 and a dependency uses
Rust 2015, works as well.</p>
<p>To be clear: most features will be available on all editions. Developers using
any Rust edition will continue to see improvements as new stable releases are
made. However, in some cases, mainly when new keywords are added, some new
features might only be available in later editions. You will need to switch
editions if you want to take advantage of such features.</p>
<p>For more details, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/edition-guide/"><em>Edition
Guide</em></a> is a complete book
about editions that enumerates the differences between editions and explains
how to automatically upgrade your code to a new edition via <code>cargo fix</code>.</p>

<p>This appendix is about how Rust is made and how that affects you as a Rust
developer.</p>
<h3 id="stability-without-stagnation"><a class="header" href="#stability-without-stagnation">Stability Without Stagnation</a></h3>
<p>As a language, Rust cares a <em>lot</em> about the stability of your code. We want
Rust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things were
constantly changing, that would be impossible. At the same time, if we can’t
experiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until after
their release, when we can no longer change things.</p>
<p>Our solution to this problem is what we call “stability without stagnation”,
and our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading to a
new version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should also
bring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster compile times.</p>
<h3 id="choo-choo-release-channels-and-riding-the-trains"><a class="header" href="#choo-choo-release-channels-and-riding-the-trains">Choo, Choo! Release Channels and Riding the Trains</a></h3>
<p>Rust development operates on a <em>train schedule</em>. That is, all development is
done on the <code>master</code> branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software
release train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software
projects. There are three <em>release channels</em> for Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nightly</li>
<li>Beta</li>
<li>Stable</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who want to
try out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how the development and release process works: let’s
assume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release
happened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version
numbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the <code>master</code>
branch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a
release day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure
automatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - *
</code></pre>
<p>Every six weeks, it’s time to prepare a new release! The <code>beta</code> branch of the
Rust repository branches off from the <code>master</code> branch used by nightly. Now,
there are two releases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *
</code></pre>
<p>Most Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta in
their CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions. In the meantime,
there’s still a nightly release every night:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the beta
release before the regression snuck into a stable release! The fix is applied
to <code>master</code>, so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix is backported to the
<code>beta</code> branch, and a new release of beta is produced:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *
</code></pre>
<p>Six weeks after the first beta was created, it’s time for a stable release! The
<code>stable</code> branch is produced from the <code>beta</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *

beta:                * - - - - - - - - *
                                       |
stable:                                *
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! Rust 1.5 is done! However, we’ve forgotten one thing: because the six
weeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the <em>next</em> version of Rust, 1.6.
So after <code>stable</code> branches off of <code>beta</code>, the next version of <code>beta</code> branches
off of <code>nightly</code> again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *
                     |                         |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *       *
                                       |
stable:                                *
</code></pre>
<p>This is called the “train model” because every six weeks, a release “leaves the
station”, but still has to take a journey through the beta channel before it
arrives as a stable release.</p>
<p>Rust releases every six weeks, like clockwork. If you know the date of one Rust
release, you can know the date of the next one: it’s six weeks later. A nice
aspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is that the next train is
coming soon. If a feature happens to miss a particular release, there’s no need
to worry: another one is happening in a short time! This helps reduce pressure
to sneak possibly unpolished features in close to the release deadline.</p>
<p>Thanks to this process, you can always check out the next build of Rust and
verify for yourself that it’s easy to upgrade to: if a beta release doesn’t
work as expected, you can report it to the team and get it fixed before the
next stable release happens! Breakage in a beta release is relatively rare, but
<code>rustc</code> is still a piece of software, and bugs do exist.</p>
<h3 id="unstable-features"><a class="header" href="#unstable-features">Unstable Features</a></h3>
<p>There’s one more catch with this release model: unstable features. Rust uses a
technique called “feature flags” to determine what features are enabled in a
given release. If a new feature is under active development, it lands on
<code>master</code>, and therefore, in nightly, but behind a <em>feature flag</em>. If you, as a
user, wish to try out the work-in-progress feature, you can, but you must be
using a nightly release of Rust and annotate your source code with the
appropriate flag to opt in.</p>
<p>If you’re using a beta or stable release of Rust, you can’t use any feature
flags. This is the key that allows us to get practical use with new features
before we declare them stable forever. Those who wish to opt into the bleeding
edge can do so, and those who want a rock-solid experience can stick with
stable and know that their code won’t break. Stability without stagnation.</p>
<p>This book only contains information about stable features, as in-progress
features are still changing, and surely they’ll be different between when this
book was written and when they get enabled in stable builds. You can find
documentation for nightly-only features online.</p>
<h3 id="rustup-and-the-role-of-rust-nightly"><a class="header" href="#rustup-and-the-role-of-rust-nightly">Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly</a></h3>
<p>Rustup makes it easy to change between different release channels of Rust, on a
global or per-project basis. By default, you’ll have stable Rust installed. To
install nightly, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup toolchain install nightly
</code></pre>
<p>You can see all of the <em>toolchains</em> (releases of Rust and associated
components) you have installed with <code>rustup</code> as well. Here’s an example on one
of your authors’ Windows computer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)
beta-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the stable toolchain is the default. Most Rust users use stable
most of the time. You might want to use stable most of the time, but use
nightly on a specific project, because you care about a cutting-edge feature.
To do so, you can use <code>rustup override</code> in that project’s directory to set the
nightly toolchain as the one <code>rustup</code> should use when you’re in that directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cd ~/projects/needs-nightly
$ rustup override set nightly
</code></pre>
<p>Now, every time you call <code>rustc</code> or <code>cargo</code> inside of
<em>~/projects/needs-nightly</em>, <code>rustup</code> will make sure that you are using nightly
Rust, rather than your default of stable Rust. This comes in handy when you
have a lot of Rust projects!</p>
<h3 id="the-rfc-process-and-teams"><a class="header" href="#the-rfc-process-and-teams">The RFC Process and Teams</a></h3>
<p>So how do you learn about these new features? Rust’s development model follows
a <em>Request For Comments (RFC) process</em>. If you’d like an improvement in Rust,
you can write up a proposal, called an RFC.</p>
<p>Anyone can write RFCs to improve Rust, and the proposals are reviewed and
discussed by the Rust team, which is comprised of many topic subteams. There’s
a full list of the teams <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance">on Rust’s
website</a>, which includes teams for
each area of the project: language design, compiler implementation,
infrastructure, documentation, and more. The appropriate team reads the
proposal and the comments, writes some comments of their own, and eventually,
there’s consensus to accept or reject the feature.</p>
<p>If the feature is accepted, an issue is opened on the Rust repository, and
someone can implement it. The person who implements it very well may not be the
person who proposed the feature in the first place! When the implementation is
ready, it lands on the <code>master</code> branch behind a feature gate, as we discussed
in the <a href="appendix-07-nightly-rust.html#unstable-features">“Unstable Features”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<p>After some time, once Rust developers who use nightly releases have been able
to try out the new feature, team members will discuss the feature, how it’s
worked out on nightly, and decide if it should make it into stable Rust or not.
If the decision is to move forward, the feature gate is removed, and the
feature is now considered stable! It rides the trains into a new stable release
of Rust.</p>

<p>Here, we used <code>fmt::Display</code> because the std library provides implementations

<p>All types which want to use <code>std::fmt</code> formatting <code>traits</code> require an
implementation to be printable. Automatic implementations are only provided
for types such as in the <code>std</code> library. All others <em>must</em> be manually
implemented somehow.</p>
<p>The <code>fmt::Debug</code> <code>trait</code> makes this very straightforward. <em>All</em> types can
<code>derive</code> (automatically create) the <code>fmt::Debug</code> implementation. This is
not true for <code>fmt::Display</code> which must be manually implemented.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// This structure cannot be printed either with `fmt::Display` or
// with `fmt::Debug`.
struct UnPrintable(i32);

// The `derive` attribute automatically creates the implementation
// required to make this `struct` printable with `fmt::Debug`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DebugPrintable(i32);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>All <code>std</code> library types are automatically printable with <code>{:?}</code> too:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!(&quot;{:?} months in a year.&quot;, 12);
    println!(&quot;{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.&quot;,
             &quot;Slater&quot;,
             &quot;Christian&quot;,
             actor=&quot;actor's&quot;);

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!(&quot;Now {:?} will print!&quot;, Structure(3));
    
    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!(&quot;Now {:?} will print!&quot;, Deep(Structure(7)));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>So <code>fmt::Debug</code> definitely makes this printable but sacrifices some
elegance. Rust also provides “pretty printing” with <code>{:#?}</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person&lt;'a&gt; {
    name: &amp;'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = &quot;Peter&quot;;
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, peter);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>One can manually implement <code>fmt::Display</code> to control the display.</p>
<h3 id="see-also-2"><a class="header" href="#see-also-2">See also:</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html"><code>attributes</code></a>, <a href="rust_by_example_src/hello/print/../../trait/derive.html"><code>derive</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/"><code>std::fmt</code></a>,

<p><code>fmt::Debug</code> hardly looks compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to
customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/"><code>fmt::Display</code></a>, which uses the <code>{}</code> print marker. Implementing it
looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure for which `fmt::Display` will be implemented. This is
// a tuple struct named `Structure` that contains an `i32`.
struct Structure(i32);

// To use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, &quot;{}&quot;, self.0)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>fmt::Display</code> may be cleaner than <code>fmt::Debug</code> but this presents
a problem for the <code>std</code> library. How should ambiguous types be displayed?
For example, if the <code>std</code> library implemented a single style for all
<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Vec&lt;path&gt;</code>: <code>/:/etc:/home/username:/bin</code> (split on <code>:</code>)</li>
<li><code>Vec&lt;number&gt;</code>: <code>1,2,3</code> (split on <code>,</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the <code>std</code> library
doesn’t presume to dictate one. <code>fmt::Display</code> is not implemented for <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
or for any other generic containers. <code>fmt::Debug</code> must then be used for these
generic cases.</p>
<p>This is not a problem though because for any new <em>container</em> type which is
<em>not</em> generic,<code>fmt::Display</code> can be implemented.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, &quot;({}, {})&quot;, self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement `Display` for `Point2D`
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, &quot;x: {}, y: {}&quot;, self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!(&quot;Compare structures:&quot;);
    println!(&quot;Display: {}&quot;, minmax);
    println!(&quot;Debug: {:?}&quot;, minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!(&quot;The big range is {big} and the small is {small}&quot;,
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!(&quot;Compare points:&quot;);
    println!(&quot;Display: {}&quot;, point);
    println!(&quot;Debug: {:?}&quot;, point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented, but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!(&quot;What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?&quot;, point);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>So, <code>fmt::Display</code> has been implemented but <code>fmt::Binary</code> has not, and
therefore cannot be used. <code>std::fmt</code> has many such <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting-traits"><code>traits</code></a> and
each requires its own implementation. This is detailed further in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/"><code>std::fmt</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="activity-1"><a class="header" href="#activity-1">Activity</a></h3>
<p>After checking the output of the above example, use the <code>Point2D</code> struct as a
guide to add a <code>Complex</code> struct to the example. When printed in the same
way, the output should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Display: 3.3 + 7.2i

<p>Implementing <code>fmt::Display</code> for a structure where the elements must each be
handled sequentially is tricky. The problem is that each <code>write!</code> generates a
<code>fmt::Result</code>. Proper handling of this requires dealing with <em>all</em> the
results. Rust provides the <code>?</code> operator for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>Using <code>?</code> on <code>write!</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Try `write!` to see if it errors. If it errors, return
// the error. Otherwise continue.
write!(f, &quot;{}&quot;, value)?;
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>?</code> available, implementing <code>fmt::Display</code> for a <code>Vec</code> is
straightforward:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">use std::fmt; // Import the `fmt` module.

// Define a structure named `List` containing a `Vec`.
struct List(Vec&lt;i32&gt;);

impl fmt::Display for List {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        // Extract the value using tuple indexing,
        // and create a reference to `vec`.
        let vec = &amp;self.0;

        write!(f, &quot;[&quot;)?;

        // Iterate over `v` in `vec` while enumerating the iteration
        // count in `count`.
        for (count, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
            // For every element except the first, add a comma.
            // Use the ? operator to return on errors.
            if count != 0 { write!(f, &quot;, &quot;)?; }
            write!(f, &quot;{}&quot;, v)?;
        }

        // Close the opened bracket and return a fmt::Result value.
        write!(f, &quot;]&quot;)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let v = List(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="activity-2"><a class="header" href="#activity-2">Activity</a></h3>
<p>Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also printed. The new output should look like this:</p>

<p>We’ve seen that formatting is specified via a <em>format string</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>format!(&quot;{}&quot;, foo)</code> -&gt; <code>&quot;3735928559&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>format!(&quot;0x{:X}&quot;, foo)</code> -&gt;

</ul>
<p>The same variable (<code>foo</code>) can be formatted differently depending on which
<em>argument type</em> is used: <code>X</code> vs <code>o</code> vs <em>unspecified</em>.</p>
<p>This formatting functionality is implemented via traits, and there is one trait
for each argument type. The most common formatting trait is <code>Display</code>, which
handles cases where the argument type is left unspecified: <code>{}</code> for instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Primitive types can be converted to each other through <a href="rust_by_example_src/types/cast.html">casting</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., <code>struct</code> and <code>enum</code>)
by the use of <a href="rust_by_example_src/trait.html">traits</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The generic conversions will use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html"><code>From</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html"><code>Into</code></a> traits.</li>
<li>However there are more specific ones for the more common cases, in particular when converting to and
from <code>String</code>s.</li>

its implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>From: If you are able to convert type A from type B</li>
<li>Into: then it should be easy to believe that we should be able to convert type B to type A.</li>

<h2 id="from"><a class="header" href="#from"><code>From</code></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html"><code>From</code></a> trait allows for a type to define how to create itself from another
type, hence providing a very simple mechanism for converting between several
types.</p>

<p>There are numerous implementations of this trait within the standard

<p>Closures are inherently flexible and will do what the functionality requires
to make the closure work without annotation. </p>
<p>This allows capturing to
flexibly adapt to the use case, sometimes moving and sometimes borrowing.</p>

<p>Closures can capture variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>by reference: <code>&amp;T</code></li>
<li>by mutable reference: <code>&amp;mut T</code></li>

<p>While Rust chooses how to capture variables on the fly mostly without type
annotation, this ambiguity is not allowed when writing functions. </p>
<p>When
taking a closure as an input parameter, the closure’s complete type must be
annotated using one of a few <code>traits</code>, and they’re determined by what the
closure does with captured value. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order of decreasing restriction, they are:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>Fn</code>: the closure uses the captured value by reference (<code>&amp;T</code>)</li>
<li><code>FnMut</code>: the closure uses the captured value by mutable reference (<code>&amp;mut T</code>)</li>
<li><code>FnOnce</code>: the closure uses the captured value by value (<code>T</code>)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>On a variable-by-variable basis, the compiler will capture variables in the
least restrictive manner possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, consider a parameter annotated as <code>FnOnce</code>. </p>
<p>This specifies
that the closure <em>may</em> capture by <code>&amp;T</code>, <code>&amp;mut T</code>, or <code>T</code>, but the compiler
will ultimately choose based on how the captured variables are used in the
closure.</p>
<p>This is because if a move is possible, then any type of borrow should also
be possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the reverse is not true: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the parameter is
annotated as <code>Fn</code>, then capturing variables by <code>&amp;mut T</code> or <code>T</code> are not
allowed. However, <code>&amp;T</code> is allowed.</p>

<p>Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure.</p>
<p>For example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that <em>bad</em> input
would clearly be problematic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noticing and explicitly managing those errors saves the rest of the program from various pitfalls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are various ways to deal with errors in Rust, which are described in the
following subchapters. They all have more or less subtle differences and different
use cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule of thumb:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An explicit <code>panic</code> is mainly useful for tests and dealing with unrecoverable errors.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For prototyping it can be useful, for example when dealing with functions that
haven’t been implemented yet, but in those cases the more descriptive <code>unimplemented</code>
is better.</li>
<li>In tests <code>panic</code> is a reasonable way to explicitly fail.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>The <code>Option</code> type is for when a value is optional or when the lack of a value is
not an error condition.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For example the parent of a directory - <code>/</code> and <code>C:</code> don’t
have one.</li>
<li>When dealing with <code>Option</code>s, <code>unwrap</code> is fine for prototyping and cases
where it’s absolutely certain that there is guaranteed to be a value.</li>
<li>However <code>expect</code>
is more useful since it lets you specify an error message in case something goes
wrong anyway.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>When there is a chance that things do go wrong and the caller has to deal with the
problem, use <code>Result</code>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> them as well (please don’t do that unless it’s a test or quick prototype).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more rigorous discussion of error handling, refer to the error
handling section in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html">official book</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest error handling mechanism we will see is <code>panic</code>.</p>

<p>In Rust, there are two ways to implement panic: unwind and abort</p>

<ol>
<li>In the unwind mode, when a panic occurs, the function calls will be exited layer by layer.
During the process, the local variables in the current stack can be destructed normally.</li>
<li>The abort method will directly exit the entire program when a panic occurs.</li>

<p>In the last example, we showed that we can induce program failure at will:</p>
<p>We told our program to <code>panic</code> if we drink a sugary lemonade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what if we expect <em>some</em> drink but don’t receive one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That case would be just as bad, so it needs to be handled!</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> test this against the null string (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>) as we do with a lemonade.</p>
<p>Since we’re using Rust, let’s instead have the compiler point out cases
where there’s no drink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <code>enum</code> called <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>std</code> library is used when absence is a
possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It manifests itself as one of two “options”:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Some(T)</code>: An element of type <code>T</code> was found</li>
<li><code>None</code>: No element was found</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These cases can either be explicitly handled via <code>match</code> or implicitly with
<code>unwrap</code>.
Implicit handling will either return the inner element or <code>panic</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it’s possible to manually customize <code>panic</code> with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.expect">expect</a>,
but <code>unwrap</code> otherwise leaves us with a less meaningful output than explicit

<p><code>map()</code> was described as a chainable way to simplify <code>match</code> statements.
However, using <code>map()</code> on a function that returns an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> results
in the nested <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chaining multiple calls together can then become confusing.
That’s where another combinator called <code>and_then()</code>, known in some languages as flatmap, comes in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>and_then()</code> calls its function input with the wrapped value and returns the result:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>Option</code> is <code>None</code>, then it returns <code>None</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example, <code>cookable_v2()</code> results in an <code>Option&lt;Food&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Rust allows us to define our own error types. In general, a “good” error type:</p>

<ul>
<li>Represents different errors with the same type</li>
<li>Presents nice error messages to the user</li>
<li>Is easy to compare with other types

<ol>
<li>
<p>In this example, the read_file function returns a Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; that indicates whether the operation was successful (and contains the contents of the file as a String) or not (and contains an io::Error with information about the failure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ? operator is used to propagate any error from the fs::read_to_string function to the caller of read_file. This means that if fs::read_to_string fails, the Err variant of the Result will be returned from read_file with the error value from fs::read_to_string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the main function, the unwrap_or_else method is used to handle any errors that may have occurred while reading the file. If read_file returns an Err, the closure passed to unwrap_or_else will be executed, which prints an error message and exits the program. If read_file returns an Ok, the String value inside the Ok will be extracted and stored in the contents variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</details>
<blockquote>
<p>Error handling in Rust is typically done using the Result type, which is an enum that can either be Ok if the operation was successful, or Err if it failed.</p>

<li>In the code above, we first try to open a file called my_file.txt using the File::open method. </li>
<li>This method returns a Result instance, which we then match on to handle the possible outcomes. 
<ul>
<li>If the Result is Ok, then it means that the file was successfully opened and we can use it. </li>
<li>If the Result is Err, then we match on the error.kind() to handle the specific error. </li>
<li>In this case, we are only handling the ErrorKind::NotFound case, where the file does not exist and we need to create it. </li>
<li>For all other errors, we panic! with a message.</li>

<p>Rust provides a powerful module system that can be used to <code>hierarchically split</code>
code in <code>logical units</code> (modules), and manage visibility (public/private) between
them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A module is a collection of items:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>functions</li>
<li>structs</li>
<li>traits</li>
<li><code>impl</code> blocks,</li>
<li>and even other modules.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="visibility"><a class="header" href="#visibility">Visibility</a></h1>
<p>By default, the items in a module have <code>private visibility</code>, but this can be
overridden with the <code>pub</code> modifier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the public items of a module can be accessed from outside the module scope.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter, we saw the following directory hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">foo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose that we wanted to have two binaries in the same project, though. What
then?</p>
<p>It turns out that <code>cargo</code> supports this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default binary name is <code>main</code>, as we saw before</li>
<li>but you can add additional binaries by placing them in a <code>bin/</code> directory:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-txt">foo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── main.rs
    └── bin
        └── my_other_bin.rs

<blockquote>
<p>To tell <code>cargo</code> to only compile or run this binary, we just pass <code>cargo</code> the
<code>--bin my_other_bin</code> flag, where <code>my_other_bin</code> is the name of the binary we
want to work with.</p>

<p><em>Generics</em> is the topic of generalizing types and functionalities to broader
cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is extremely useful for reducing code duplication in many ways,
but can call for rather involved syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Namely, being generic requires
taking great care to specify over which types a generic type
is actually considered valid.</p>
<h2 id="type-parameters"><a class="header" href="#type-parameters">type parameters</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest and most common use of generics is for type parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A type parameter is specified as generic by the use of angle brackets and upper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">camel case</a>: <code>&lt;Aaa, Bbb, ...&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>“Generic type parameters” are typically represented as <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. </li>
<li>In Rust, “generic” also describes anything that accepts one or more generic type parameters <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. </li>
<li>Any type specified as a
generic type parameter is generic, and everything else is concrete (non-generic).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, defining a <em>generic function</em> named <code>foo</code> that takes an argument
<code>T</code> of any type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T&gt;(arg: T) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>T</code> has been specified as a generic type parameter using <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>, it
is considered generic when used here as <code>(arg: T)</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the case even if <code>T</code> has previously been defined as a <code>struct</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example shows some of the syntax in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">// A concrete type `A`.
struct A;

// In defining the type `Single`, the first use of `A` is not preceded by `&lt;A&gt;`.
// Therefore, `Single` is a concrete type, and `A` is defined as above.
struct Single(A);
//            ^ Here is `Single`s first use of the type `A`.

// Here, `&lt;T&gt;` precedes the first use of `T`, so `SingleGen` is a generic type.
// Because the type parameter `T` is generic, it could be anything, including
// the concrete type `A` defined at the top.
struct SingleGen&lt;T&gt;(T);

fn main() {
    // `Single` is concrete and explicitly takes `A`.
    let _s = Single(A);
    
    // Create a variable `_char` of type `SingleGen&lt;char&gt;`
    // and give it the value `SingleGen('a')`.
    // Here, `SingleGen` has **a type parameter explicitly specified**.
    let _char: SingleGen&lt;char&gt; = SingleGen('a');

    // `SingleGen` can also have a type parameter implicitly specified:
    let _t    = SingleGen(A); // Uses `A` defined at the top.
    let _i32  = SingleGen(6); // Uses `i32`.
    let _char = SingleGen('a'); // Uses `char`.
}

<p>The same set of rules can be applied to functions: a type <code>T</code> becomes
generic when preceded by <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using generic functions sometimes requires explicitly specifying type 
parameters. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>

<p>The Rust compiler needs to know how much space every function’s return type requires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means all your functions have to return a concrete type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike other languages, if you have a trait like <code>Animal</code>, you can’t write a function that returns <code>Animal</code>, because its different implementations will need different amounts of memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there’s an easy workaround.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of returning a trait object directly, our functions return a <code>Box</code> which <em>contains</em> some <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <code>box</code> is just a reference to some memory <strong>in the heap</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Because a reference has a statically-known size</li>
<li>and the compiler can guarantee it points to a heap-allocated <code>Animal</code></li>
<li>we can return a trait from our function!</li>
</ul>

<p>Rust tries to be as explicit as possible whenever it allocates memory on the heap.</p>

<p>In Rust, many of the operators can be overloaded via traits. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, some operators can be used to accomplish different tasks <strong>based on their input arguments</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is possible because operators are syntactic sugar for method calls. </p>
<p>For example, the <code>+</code> operator in
<code>a + b</code> calls the <code>add</code> method (as in <code>a.add(b)</code>). This <code>add</code> method is part of the <code>Add</code>
trait. Hence, the <code>+</code> operator can be used by any implementor of the <code>Add</code> trait.</p>
<p>A list of the traits, such as <code>Add</code>, that overload operators can be found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/"><code>core::ops</code></a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="macro_rules"><a class="header" href="#macro_rules">macro_rules!</a></h1>
<p>Rust provides a powerful macro system that allows metaprogramming. As you’ve
seen in previous chapters, macros look like functions, except that their name
ends with a bang <code>!</code>, but instead of generating a function call, macros are
expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program.
However, unlike macros in C and other languages, Rust macros are expanded into
abstract syntax trees, rather than string preprocessing, so you don’t get
unexpected precedence bugs.</p>
<p>Macros are created using the <code>macro_rules!</code> macro.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">// This is a simple macro named `say_hello`.
macro_rules! say_hello {
    // `()` indicates that the macro takes no argument.
    () =&gt; {
        // The macro will expand into the contents of this block.
        println!(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
    };
}

fn main() {
    // This call will expand into `println!(&quot;Hello&quot;);`
    say_hello!()
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>So why are macros useful?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don’t repeat yourself. There are many cases where you may need similar
functionality in multiple places but with different types. Often, writing a
macro is a useful way to avoid repeating code. (More on this later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain-specific languages. Macros allow you to define special syntax for a
specific purpose. (More on this later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variadic interfaces. Sometimes you want to define an interface that takes a
variable number of arguments. An example is <code>println!</code> which could take any
number of arguments, depending on the format string. (More on this later)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="syntax"><a class="header" href="#syntax">Syntax</a></h1>
<p>In following subsections, we will show how to define macros in Rust.
There are three basic ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="rust_by_example_src/macros/designators.html">Patterns and Designators</a></li>
<li><a href="rust_by_example_src/macros/overload.html">Overloading</a></li>
<li><a href="rust_by_example_src/macros/repeat.html">Repetition</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="designators"><a class="header" href="#designators">Designators</a></h1>
<p>The arguments of a macro are prefixed by a dollar sign <code>$</code> and type annotated
with a <em>designator</em>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">macro_rules! create_function {
    // This macro takes an argument of designator `ident` and
    // creates a function named `$func_name`.
    // The `ident` designator is used for variable/function names.
    ($func_name:ident) =&gt; {
        fn $func_name() {
            // The `stringify!` macro converts an `ident` into a string.
            println!(&quot;You called {:?}()&quot;,
                     stringify!($func_name));
        }
    };
}

// Create functions named `foo` and `bar` with the above macro.
create_function!(foo);
create_function!(bar);

macro_rules! print_result {
    // This macro takes an expression of type `expr` and prints
    // it as a string along with its result.
    // The `expr` designator is used for expressions.
    ($expression:expr) =&gt; {
        // `stringify!` will convert the expression *as it is* into a string.
        println!(&quot;{:?} = {:?}&quot;,
                 stringify!($expression),
                 $expression);
    };
}

fn main() {
    foo();
    bar();

    print_result!(1u32 + 1);

    // Recall that blocks are expressions too!
    print_result!({
        let x = 1u32;

        x * x + 2 * x - 1
    });
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>These are some of the available designators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>block</code></li>
<li><code>expr</code> is used for expressions</li>
<li><code>ident</code> is used for variable/function names</li>
<li><code>item</code></li>
<li><code>literal</code> is used for literal constants</li>
<li><code>pat</code> (<em>pattern</em>)</li>
<li><code>path</code></li>
<li><code>stmt</code> (<em>statement</em>)</li>
<li><code>tt</code> (<em>token tree</em>)</li>
<li><code>ty</code> (<em>type</em>)</li>
<li><code>vis</code> (<em>visibility qualifier</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list, see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html">Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overload"><a class="header" href="#overload">Overload</a></h1>
<p>Macros can be overloaded to accept different combinations of arguments. 
In that regard, <code>macro_rules!</code> can work similarly to a match block:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">// `test!` will compare `$left` and `$right`
// in different ways depending on how you invoke it:
macro_rules! test {
    // Arguments don't need to be separated by a comma.
    // Any template can be used!
    ($left:expr; and $right:expr) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{:?} and {:?} is {:?}&quot;,
                 stringify!($left),
                 stringify!($right),
                 $left &amp;&amp; $right)
    };
    // ^ each arm must end with a semicolon.
    ($left:expr; or $right:expr) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{:?} or {:?} is {:?}&quot;,
                 stringify!($left),
                 stringify!($right),
                 $left || $right)
    };
}

fn main() {
    test!(1i32 + 1 == 2i32; and 2i32 * 2 == 4i32);
    test!(true; or false);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="repeat"><a class="header" href="#repeat">Repeat</a></h1>
<p>Macros can use <code>+</code> in the argument list to indicate that an argument may
repeat at least once, or <code>*</code>, to indicate that the argument may repeat zero or
more times.</p>
<p>In the following example, surrounding the matcher with <code>$(...),+</code> will
match one or more expression, separated by commas.
Also note that the semicolon is optional on the last case.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">// `find_min!` will calculate the minimum of any number of arguments.
macro_rules! find_min {
    // Base case:
    ($x:expr) =&gt; ($x);
    // `$x` followed by at least one `$y,`
    ($x:expr, $($y:expr),+) =&gt; (
        // Call `find_min!` on the tail `$y`
        std::cmp::min($x, find_min!($($y),+))
    )
}

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, find_min!(1));
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, find_min!(1 + 2, 2));
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, find_min!(5, 2 * 3, 4));
}

<p>Macros allow writing DRY code by factoring out the common parts of functions
and/or test suites. Here is an example that implements and tests the <code>+=</code>, <code>*=</code>

<p>A DSL is a mini “language” embedded in a Rust macro. It is completely valid
Rust because the macro system expands into normal Rust constructs, but it looks
like a small language. This allows you to define concise or intuitive syntax for
some special functionality (within bounds).</p>
<p>Suppose that I want to define a little calculator API. I would like to supply
an expression and have the output printed to console.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">macro_rules! calculate {
    (eval $e:expr) =&gt; {
        {
            let val: usize = $e; // Force types to be integers
            println!(&quot;{} = {}&quot;, stringify!{$e}, val);

<p>This was a very simple example, but much more complex interfaces have been
developed, such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static"><code>lazy_static</code></a> or
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap"><code>clap</code></a>.</p>
<p>Also, note the two pairs of braces in the macro. The outer ones are
part of the syntax of <code>macro_rules!</code>, in addition to <code>()</code> or <code>[]</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>variadic</em> interface takes an arbitrary number of arguments. For example,

<p>We can extend our <code>calculate!</code> macro from the previous section to be variadic:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust editable">macro_rules! calculate {

<p>Consider a <code>HashSet</code> as a <code>HashMap</code> where we just care about the keys (
<code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> is, in actuality, just a wrapper around <code>HashMap&lt;T, ()&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>“What’s the point of that?” you ask. “I could just store the keys in a <code>Vec</code>.”</p>
<p>A <code>HashSet</code>’s unique feature is that
it is guaranteed to not have duplicate elements.
That’s the contract that any set collection fulfills.
<code>HashSet</code> is just one implementation. (see also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html"><code>BTreeSet</code></a>)</p>
<p>If you insert a value that is already present in the <code>HashSet</code>,
(i.e. the new value is equal to the existing and they both have the same hash),
then the new value will replace the old.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is great for when you never want more than one of something,
or when you want to know if you’ve already got something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But sets can do more than that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets have 4 primary operations (all of the following calls return an iterator):</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>union</code>: get all the unique elements in both sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>difference</code>: get all the elements that are in the first set but not the second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>intersection</code>: get all the elements that are only in <em>both</em> sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>symmetric_difference</code>:
get all the elements that are in one set or the other, but <em>not</em> both.</p>

<p>The <code>Path</code> struct represents file paths in the underlying filesystem.</p>
<p>There are two flavors of <code>Path</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>posix::Path</code>, for UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>and <code>windows::Path</code>, for Windows.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The prelude exports the appropriate platform-specific <code>Path</code> variant.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <code>Path</code> can be created from an <code>OsStr</code>, and provides several methods to get
information from the file/directory the path points to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>Path</code> is immutable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owned version of <code>Path</code> is <code>PathBuf</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The relation between <code>Path</code> and <code>PathBuf</code> is similar to that of <code>str</code> and <code>String</code>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a <code>PathBuf</code> can be mutated in-place,</li>
<li>and can be dereferenced to a <code>Path</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that a <code>Path</code> is <em>not</em> internally represented as an UTF-8 string, but
instead is stored as an <code>OsString</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, converting a <code>Path</code> to a <code>&amp;str</code> is <em>not</em> free and may fail (an <code>Option</code> is returned).</li>
<li>However, a <code>Path</code> can be
freely converted to an <code>OsString</code> or <code>&amp;OsStr</code> using <code>into_os_string</code> and <code>as_os_str</code>, respectively.</li>

<p>Rust provides support for <code>inline assembly</code> via the <code>asm!</code> macro.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can be used to embed handwritten assembly in the assembly output generated by the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Generally this should not be necessary, but might be where the required performance or timing cannot be otherwise achieved.</li>
<li>Accessing low level hardware primitives, e.g. in kernel code, may also demand this functionality.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the examples here are given in x86/x86-64 assembly, but other architectures are also supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Inline assembly is currently supported on the following architectures:</p>

<ul>
<li>x86 and x86-64</li>
<li>ARM</li>
<li>AArch64</li>

<p>The Rust compiler is conservative with its allocation of operands. It is assumed that an <code>out</code>

<blockquote>
<p>However, to guarantee optimal performance it is important to use as few registers as possible, so they won’t have to be saved and reloaded around the inline assembly block.</p>

<li>In the example above we use the <code>cpuid</code> instruction to read the CPU manufacturer ID.</li>
<li>This instruction writes to <code>eax</code> with the maximum supported <code>cpuid</code> argument and <code>ebx</code>, <code>edx</code>, and <code>ecx</code> with the CPU manufacturer ID as ASCII bytes in that order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though <code>eax</code> is never read we still need to tell the compiler that the register has been modified so that the compiler can save any values that were in these registers before the asm. This is done by declaring it as an output but with <code>_</code> instead of a variable name, which indicates that the
output value is to be discarded.</p>
<p>This code also works around the limitation that <code>ebx</code> is a reserved register by LLVM. That means that LLVM assumes that it has full control over the register and it must be restored to its original state before exiting the asm block, so it cannot be used as an input or output <strong>except</strong> if the
compiler uses it to fulfill a general register class (e.g. <code>in(reg)</code>). This makes <code>reg</code> operands dangerous when using reserved registers as we could unknowingly corrupt out input or output because they share the same register.</p>
<p>To work around this we use <code>rdi</code> to store the pointer to the output array, save <code>ebx</code> via <code>push</code>, read from <code>ebx</code> inside the asm block into the array and then restoring <code>ebx</code> to its original state via <code>pop</code>. The <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> use the full 64-bit <code>rbx</code> version of the register to ensure that the
entire register is saved. On 32 bit targets the code would instead use <code>ebx</code> in the <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, we use the <code>reg_abcd</code> register class to restrict the register allocator to the 4 legacy x86 registers (<code>ax</code>, <code>bx</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>) of which the first two bytes can be addressed independently.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the register allocator has chosen to allocate <code>x</code> in the <code>ax</code> register.
The <code>h</code> modifier will emit the register name for the high byte of that register and the <code>l</code> modifier will emit the register name for the low byte. The asm code will therefore be expanded as <code>mov ah, al</code> which copies the low byte of the value into the high byte.</p>

<p>Any reuse of a named label, local or otherwise, can result in an assembler or linker error or may cause other strange behavior.</p>

<p>Reuse of a named label can happen in a variety of ways including:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>explicitly:
using a label more than once in one <code>asm!</code> block, or multiple times across blocks.</li>
<li>implicitly via inlining:
the compiler is allowed to instantiate multiple copies of an <code>asm!</code> block, for example when the function containing it is inlined in multiple places.</li>
<li>implicitly via LTO:
LTO can cause code from <em>other crates</em> to be placed in the same codegen unit, and so could bring in arbitrary labels.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a consequence, you should only use GNU assembler <strong>numeric</strong> <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Symbol-Names.html#Local-Labels">local labels</a> inside inline assembly code. Defining symbols in assembly code may lead to assembler and/or linker errors due to duplicate symbol definitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, on x86 when using the default Intel syntax, due to <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36144">an LLVM bug</a>, you shouldn’t use labels exclusively made of <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> digits, e.g. <code>0</code>, <code>11</code> or <code>101010</code>, as they may end up being interpreted as binary values.</p>
<p>Using <code>options(att_syntax)</code> will avoid any ambiguity, but that affects the syntax of the <em>entire</em> <code>asm!</code> block. (See <a href="rust_by_example_src/unsafe/asm.html#options">Options</a>, below, for more on <code>options</code>.)</p>

<p>Options can be provided as an optional final argument to the <code>asm!</code> macro.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We specified three options here:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>pure</code> means that the asm code has no observable side effects and that its output depends only on its inputs. This allows the compiler optimizer to call the inline asm fewer times or even eliminate it entirely.</li>
<li><code>nomem</code> means that the asm code does not read or write to memory. By default the compiler will assume that inline assembly can read or write any memory address that is accessible to it (e.g. through a pointer passed as an operand, or a global).</li>
<li><code>nostack</code> means that the asm code does not push any data onto the stack. This allows the compiler to use optimizations such as the stack red zone on x86-64 to avoid stack pointer adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These allow the compiler to better optimize code using <code>asm!</code>, for example by eliminating pure <code>asm!</code> blocks whose outputs are not needed.</p>

<p>PyO3 supports the following software versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.7 and up (CPython and PyPy)</li>
<li>Rust 1.48 and up</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use PyO3 to write a native Python module in Rust, or to embed Python in a Rust binary. The following sections explain each of these in turn.</p>
<h3 id="using-rust-from-python"><a class="header" href="#using-rust-from-python">Using Rust from Python</a></h3>
<p>PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module. The easiest way to try this out for the first time is to use <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin"><code>maturin</code></a>. <code>maturin</code> is a tool for building and publishing Rust-based Python packages with minimal configuration. The following steps install <code>maturin</code>, use it to generate and build a new Python package, and then launch Python to import and execute a function from the package.</p>
<p>First, follow the commands below to create a new directory containing a new Python <code>virtualenv</code>, and install <code>maturin</code> into the virtualenv using Python's package manager, <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># (replace string_sum with the desired package name)
$ mkdir string_sum
$ cd string_sum
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install maturin
</code></pre>
<p>Still inside this <code>string_sum</code> directory, now run <code>maturin init</code>. This will generate the new package source. When given the choice of bindings to use, select pyo3 bindings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ maturin init
✔ 🤷 What kind of bindings to use? · pyo3
  ✨ Done! New project created string_sum
</code></pre>
<p>The most important files generated by this command are <code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>lib.rs</code>, which will look roughly like the following:</p>
<p><strong><code>Cargo.toml</code></strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2018&quot;

[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_sum`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
# &quot;cdylib&quot; is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_sum;` unless the &quot;rlib&quot; or &quot;lib&quot; crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;, &quot;rlib&quot;]
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = &quot;0.17.3&quot;, features = [&quot;extension-module&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>src/lib.rs</code></strong></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
#[pyfunction]
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -&gt; PyResult&lt;String&gt; {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this function must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pymodule]
fn string_sum(_py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Finally, run <code>maturin develop</code>. This will build the package and install it into the Python virtualenv previously created and activated. The package is then ready to be used from <code>python</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string_sum
&gt;&gt;&gt; string_sum.sum_as_string(5, 20)
'25'
</code></pre>
<p>To make changes to the package, just edit the Rust source code and then re-run <code>maturin develop</code> to recompile.</p>
<p>To run this all as a single copy-and-paste, use the bash script below (replace <code>string_sum</code> in the first command with the desired package name):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir string_sum &amp;&amp; cd &quot;$_&quot;
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin init --bindings pyo3
maturin develop
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to be able to run <code>cargo test</code> or use this project in a Cargo workspace and are running into linker issues, there are some workarounds in <a href="https://pyo3.rs/latest/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-or-i-cant-build-in-a-cargo-workspace-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror">the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>As well as with <code>maturin</code>, it is possible to build using <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust"><code>setuptools-rust</code></a> or <a href="https://pyo3.rs/latest/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds">manually</a>. Both offer more flexibility than <code>maturin</code> but require more configuration to get started.</p>
<h3 id="using-python-from-rust"><a class="header" href="#using-python-from-rust">Using Python from Rust</a></h3>
<p>To embed Python into a Rust binary, you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library. The following steps demonstrate how to ensure this (for Ubuntu), and then give some example code which runs an embedded Python interpreter.</p>
<p>To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install python3-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Start a new project with <code>cargo new</code> and add  <code>pyo3</code> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> like this:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="installation-1"><a class="header" href="#installation-1">Installation</a></h1>
<p>To get started using PyO3 you will need three things: a rust toolchain, a python environment, and a way to build. We’ll cover each of these below.</p>
<h2 id="rust"><a class="header" href="#rust">Rust</a></h2>
<p>First, make sure you have rust installed on your system. If you haven’t already done so you can do so by following the instructions <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">here</a>. PyO3 runs on both the <code>stable</code> and <code>nightly</code> versions so you can choose whichever one fits you best. The minimum required rust version is Rust 1.48.</p>
<p>if you can run <code>rustc --version</code> and the version is high enough you’re good to go!</p>
<h2 id="python-1"><a class="header" href="#python-1">Python</a></h2>
<p>To use PyO3 you need at least Python 3.7. While you can simply use the default Python version on your system, it is recommended to use a virtual environment.</p>
<h2 id="virtualenvs"><a class="header" href="#virtualenvs">Virtualenvs</a></h2>
<p>While you can use any virtualenv manager you like, we recommend the use of <code>pyenv</code> especially if you want to develop or test for multiple different python versions, so that is what the examples in this book will use. The installation instructions for <code>pyenv</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#getting-pyenv">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that when using <code>pyenv</code> you should also set the following environment variable</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=&quot;--enable-shared&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="building"><a class="header" href="#building">Building</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of build and python package management systems such as <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust"><code>setuptools-rust</code></a> or <a href="https://pyo3.rs/latest/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds">manually</a>  we recommend the use of <code>maturin</code> which you can install <a href="https://maturin.rs/installation.html">here</a>. It is developed to work with PyO3 and is the most “batteries included” experience. <code>maturin</code> is just a python package so you can add it in any way that you install python packages.</p>
<p>System Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install maturin --user
</code></pre>
<p>pipx:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pipx install maturin
</code></pre>
<p>pyenv:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pyenv activate pyo3
pip install maturin
</code></pre>
<p>poetry:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">poetry add -D maturin
</code></pre>
<p>after installation, you can run <code>maturin --version</code> to check that you have correctly installed it.</p>
<h1 id="starting-a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-new-project">Starting a new project</a></h1>
<p>Firstly you should create the folder and virtual environment that are going to contain your new project. Here we will use the recommended <code>pyenv</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir pyo3-example
cd pyo3-example
pyenv virtualenv pyo3
pyenv local pyo3
</code></pre>
<p>after this, you should install your build manager. In this example, we will use <code>maturin</code>. After you’ve activated your virtualenv add <code>maturin</code> to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install maturin
</code></pre>
<p>After this, you can initialise the new project</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">maturin init
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>maturin</code> is already installed you can create a new project using that directly as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">maturin new -b pyo3 pyo3-example
cd pyo3-example
pyenv virtualenv pyo3
pyenv local pyo3
</code></pre>
<h1 id="adding-to-an-existing-project"><a class="header" href="#adding-to-an-existing-project">Adding to an existing project</a></h1>
<p>Sadly currently <code>maturin</code> cannot be run in existing projects, so if you want to use python in an existing project you basically have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a new project as above and move your existing code into that project</li>
<li>Manually edit your project configuration as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are opting for the second option, here are the things you need to pay attention to:</p>
<h2 id="cargotoml"><a class="header" href="#cargotoml">Cargo.toml</a></h2>
<p>Make sure that the rust you want to be able to access from Python is compiled into a library. You can have a binary output as well, but the code you want to access from python has to be in the library. Also, make sure that the crate type is <code>cdylib</code>  and add PyO3 as a dependency as so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># If you already have [package] information in `Cargo.toml`, you can ignore
# this section!
[package]
# `name` here is name of the package.
name = &quot;pyo3_start&quot;
# these are good defaults:
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_sum`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = &quot;pyo3_example&quot;

# &quot;cdylib&quot; is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { {{#PYO3_CRATE_VERSION}}, features = [&quot;extension-module&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pyprojecttoml"><a class="header" href="#pyprojecttoml">pyproject.toml</a></h2>
<p>You should also create a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-system]
requires = [&quot;maturin&gt;=0.13,&lt;0.14&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;maturin&quot;

[project]
name = &quot;pyo3_example&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.7&quot;
classifiers = [
    &quot;Programming Language :: Rust&quot;,
    &quot;Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython&quot;,
    &quot;Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-code"><a class="header" href="#running-code">Running code</a></h2>
<p>After this you can setup rust code to be available in python as below; for example, you can place this code in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
#[pyfunction]
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -&gt; PyResult&lt;String&gt; {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this function must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pymodule]
fn pyo3_example(_py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>After this you can run <code>maturin develop</code> to prepare the python package after which you can use it like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyo3_example
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyo3_example.sum_as_string(5, 20)
'25'
</code></pre>
<p>For more instructions on how to use python code from rust see the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/python_from_rust.html">Python from Rust</a> page.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="python-modules"><a class="header" href="#python-modules">Python modules</a></h1>
<p>You can create a module using <code>#[pymodule]</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
fn double(x: usize) -&gt; usize {
    x * 2
}

/// This module is implemented in Rust.
#[pymodule]
fn my_extension(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(double, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>#[pymodule]</code> procedural macro takes care of exporting the initialization function of your
module to Python.</p>
<p>The module’s name defaults to the name of the Rust function. You can override the module name by
using <code>#[pyo3(name = &quot;custom_name&quot;)]</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
fn double(x: usize) -&gt; usize {
    x * 2
}

#[pymodule]
#[pyo3(name = &quot;custom_name&quot;)]
fn my_extension(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(double, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The name of the module must match the name of the <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code>
file. Otherwise, you will get an import error in Python with the following message:
<code>ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_name_of_your_module)</code></p>
<p>To import the module, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy the shared library as described in <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds">Manual builds</a>, or</li>
<li>use a tool, e.g. <code>maturin develop</code> with <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin">maturin</a> or
<code>python setup.py develop</code> with <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust">setuptools-rust</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-04-comments.html">Rust doc comments</a> of the module
initialization function will be applied automatically as the Python docstring of your module.</p>
<p>For example, building off of the above code, this will print <code>This module is implemented in Rust.</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import my_extension

print(my_extension.__doc__)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="python-submodules"><a class="header" href="#python-submodules">Python submodules</a></h2>
<p>You can create a module hierarchy within a single extension module by using
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/prelude/struct.PyModule.html#method.add_submodule"><code>PyModule.add_submodule()</code></a>.
For example, you could define the modules <code>parent_module</code> and <code>parent_module.child_module</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pymodule]
fn parent_module(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    register_child_module(py, m)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn register_child_module(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, parent_module: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    let child_module = PyModule::new(py, &quot;child_module&quot;)?;
    child_module.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(func, child_module)?)?;
    parent_module.add_submodule(child_module)?;
    Ok(())
}

#[pyfunction]
fn func() -&gt; String {
    &quot;func&quot;.to_string()
}

<span class="boring">Python::with_gil(|py| {
</span><span class="boring">   use pyo3::wrap_pymodule;

</span><span class="boring">})
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that this does not define a package, so this won’t allow Python code to directly import
submodules by using <code>from parent_module import child_module</code>. For more information, see
<a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/759">#759</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1517#issuecomment-808664021">#1517</a>.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to add <code>#[pymodule]</code> on nested modules, which is only required on the top-level module.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="python-functions"><a class="header" href="#python-functions">Python functions</a></h1>
<p>The <code>#[pyfunction]</code> attribute is used to define a Python function from a Rust function. Once defined, the function needs to be added to a <a href="PyO3_guides/src/./module.html">module</a> using the <code>wrap_pyfunction!</code> macro.</p>
<p>The following example defines a function called <code>double</code> in a Python module called <code>my_extension</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

<h3 id="calling-rust-functions-in-python"><a class="header" href="#calling-rust-functions-in-python">Calling Rust functions in Python</a></h3>
<p>The ways to convert a Rust function into a Python object vary depending on the function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Named functions, e.g. <code>fn foo()</code>: add <code>#[pyfunction]</code> and then use <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/macro.wrap_pyfunction.html"><code>wrap_pyfunction!</code></a> to get the corresponding <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/types/struct.PyCFunction.html"><code>PyCFunction</code></a>.</li>
<li>Anonymous functions (or closures), e.g. <code>foo: fn()</code> either:
<ul>
<li>use a <code>#[pyclass]</code> struct which stores the function as a field and implement <code>__call__</code> to call the stored function.</li>
<li>use <code>PyFunction::new_closure</code> to create an object directly from the function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessing-the-ffi-functions"><a class="header" href="#accessing-the-ffi-functions">Accessing the FFI functions</a></h3>
<p>In order to make Rust functions callable from Python, PyO3 generates an <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>
function whose exact signature depends on the Rust signature.  (PyO3 chooses the optimal
Python argument passing convention.) It then embeds the call to the Rust function inside this
FFI-wrapper function. This wrapper handles extraction of the regular arguments and the keyword
arguments from the input <code>PyObject</code>s.</p>
<p>The <code>wrap_pyfunction</code> macro can be used to directly get a <code>PyCFunction</code> given a
<code>#[pyfunction]</code> and a <code>PyModule</code>: <code>wrap_pyfunction!(rust_fun, module)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="pyfn-shorthand"><a class="header" href="#pyfn-shorthand"><code>#[pyfn]</code> shorthand</a></h2>
<p>There is a shorthand to <code>#[pyfunction]</code> and <code>wrap_pymodule!</code>: the function can be placed inside the module definition and
annotated with <code>#[pyfn]</code>. To simplify PyO3, it is expected that <code>#[pyfn]</code> may be removed in a future release (See <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/694">#694</a>).</p>
<p>An example of <code>#[pyfn]</code> is below:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pymodule]
fn my_extension(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {

    #[pyfn(m)]
    fn double(x: usize) -&gt; usize {
        x * 2
    }

    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>#[pyfn(m)]</code> is just syntactic sugar for <code>#[pyfunction]</code>, and takes all the same options
documented in the rest of this chapter. The code above is expanded to the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pymodule]
fn my_extension(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {

    #[pyfunction]
    fn double(x: usize) -&gt; usize {
        x * 2
    }

    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(double, m)?)?;
    Ok(())

</span></code></pre></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="function-signatures"><a class="header" href="#function-signatures">Function signatures</a></h1>
<p>The <code>#[pyfunction]</code> attribute also accepts parameters to control how the generated Python function accepts arguments. Just like in Python, arguments can be positional-only, keyword-only, or accept either. <code>*args</code> lists and <code>**kwargs</code> dicts can also be accepted. These parameters also work for <code>#[pymethods]</code> which will be introduced in the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/../class.html">Python Classes</a> section of the guide.</p>
<p>Like Python, by default PyO3 accepts all arguments as either positional or keyword arguments. There are two ways to modify this behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>#[pyo3(signature = (...))]</code> option which allows writing a signature in Python syntax.</li>
<li>Extra arguments directly to <code>#[pyfunction]</code>. (See deprecated form)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-pyo3signature--"><a class="header" href="#using-pyo3signature--">Using <code>#[pyo3(signature = (...))]</code></a></h2>
<p>For example, below is a function that accepts arbitrary keyword arguments (<code>**kwargs</code> in Python syntax) and returns the number that was passed:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::PyDict;

#[pyfunction]
#[pyo3(signature = (**kwds))]
fn num_kwds(kwds: Option&lt;&amp;PyDict&gt;) -&gt; usize {
    kwds.map_or(0, |dict| dict.len())
}

#[pymodule]
fn module_with_functions(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(num_kwds, m)?).unwrap();
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Just like in Python, the following constructs can be part of the signature::</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code>: positional-only arguments separator, each parameter defined before <code>/</code> is a positional-only parameter.</li>
<li><code>*</code>: var arguments separator, each parameter defined after <code>*</code> is a keyword-only parameter.</li>
<li><code>*args</code>: “args” is var args. Type of the <code>args</code> parameter has to be <code>&amp;PyTuple</code>.</li>
<li><code>**kwargs</code>: “kwargs” receives keyword arguments. The type of the <code>kwargs</code> parameter has to be <code>Option&lt;&amp;PyDict&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>arg=Value</code>: arguments with default value.
If the <code>arg</code> argument is defined after var arguments, it is treated as a keyword-only argument.
Note that <code>Value</code> has to be valid rust code, PyO3 just inserts it into the generated
code unmodified.</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B. the position of the <code>/</code> and <code>*</code> arguments (if included) control the system of handling positional and keyword arguments. In Python:</p>

<p>This chapter contains a little background of error handling in Rust and how PyO3 integrates this with Python exceptions.</p>
<p>This covers enough detail to create a <code>#[pyfunction]</code> which raises Python exceptions from errors originating in Rust.</p>
<p>There is a later section of the guide on <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/../exception.html">Python exceptions</a> which covers exception types in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="representing-python-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#representing-python-exceptions">Representing Python exceptions</a></h2>
<p>Rust code uses the generic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code></a> enum to propagate errors. The error type <code>E</code> is chosen by the code author to describe the possible errors which can happen.</p>
<p>PyO3 has the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.PyErr.html"><code>PyErr</code></a> type which represents a Python exception. If a PyO3 API could result in a Python exception being raised, the return type of that <code>API</code> will be <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/prelude/type.PyResult.html"><code>PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, which is an alias for the type <code>Result&lt;T, PyErr&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Python exceptions are raised and caught by PyO3, the exception will stored in the <code>Err</code> variant of the <code>PyResult</code>.</li>
<li>Passing Python exceptions through Rust code then uses all the “normal” techniques such as the <code>?</code> operator, with <code>PyErr</code> as the error type.</li>
<li>Finally, when a <code>PyResult</code> crosses from Rust back to Python via PyO3, if the result is an <code>Err</code> variant the contained exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There are many great tutorials on Rust error handling and the <code>?</code> operator, so this guide will not go into detail on Rust-specific topics.)</p>
<h2 id="raising-an-exception-from-a-function"><a class="header" href="#raising-an-exception-from-a-function">Raising an exception from a function</a></h2>
<p>As indicated in the previous section, when a <code>PyResult</code> containing an <code>Err</code> crosses from Rust to Python, PyO3 will raise the exception contained within.</p>
<p>Accordingly, to raise an exception from a <code>#[pyfunction]</code>, change the return type <code>T</code> to <code>PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code>. When the function returns an <code>Err</code> it will raise a Python exception. (Other <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> types can be used as long as the error <code>E</code> has a <code>From</code> conversion for <code>PyErr</code>, see <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/error_handling.html#implementing-an-error-conversion">implementing a conversion</a> below.)</p>
<p>This also works for functions in <code>#[pymethods]</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the following <code>check_positive</code> function raises a <code>ValueError</code> when the input is negative:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError;
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
fn check_positive(x: i32) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    if x &lt; 0 {
        Err(PyValueError::new_err(&quot;x is negative&quot;))
    } else {
        Ok(())
    }
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main(){
</span><span class="boring">	Python::with_gil(|py|{
</span><span class="boring">		let fun = pyo3::wrap_pyfunction!(check_positive, py).unwrap();
</span><span class="boring">		fun.call1((-1,)).unwrap_err();
</span><span class="boring">		fun.call1((1,)).unwrap();
</span><span class="boring">	});
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>All built-in Python exception types are defined in the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/exceptions/index.html"><code>pyo3::exceptions</code></a> module. They have a <code>new_err</code> constructor to directly build a <code>PyErr</code>, as seen in the example above.</p>
<h2 id="custom-rust-error-types"><a class="header" href="#custom-rust-error-types">Custom Rust error types</a></h2>
<p>PyO3 will automatically convert a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> returned by a <code>#[pyfunction]</code> into a <code>PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code> as long as there is an implementation of <code>std::from::From&lt;E&gt; for PyErr</code>. Many error types in the Rust standard library have a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.From.html"><code>From</code></a> conversion defined in this way.</p>
<p>If the type <code>E</code> you are handling is defined in a third-party crate, see the section on <a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/error_handling.html#foreign-rust-error-types">foreign rust error types</a> below for ways to work with this error.</p>
<p>The following example makes use of the implementation of <code>From&lt;ParseIntError&gt; for PyErr</code> to raise exceptions encountered when parsing strings as integers:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span>use std::num::ParseIntError;

#[pyfunction]
fn parse_int(x: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;usize, ParseIntError&gt; {
    x.parse()
}

<span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    Python::with_gil(|py| {
</span><span class="boring">        let fun = pyo3::wrap_pyfunction!(parse_int, py).unwrap();
</span><span class="boring">        let value: usize = fun.call1((&quot;5&quot;,)).unwrap().extract().unwrap();
</span><span class="boring">        assert_eq!(value, 5);
</span><span class="boring">    });
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When passed a string which doesn’t contain a floating-point number, the exception raised will look like the below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; parse_int(&quot;bar&quot;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid digit found in string
</code></pre>
<p>As a more complete example, the following snippet defines a Rust error named <code>CustomIOError</code>. It then defines a <code>From&lt;CustomIOError&gt; for PyErr</code>, which returns a <code>PyErr</code> representing Python’s <code>OSError</code>. Finally, it</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use pyo3::exceptions::PyOSError;

        assert!(err.is_instance_of::&lt;PyOSError&gt;(py));

<p>If lazy construction of the Python exception instance is desired, the
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/function/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/trait.PyErrArguments.html"><code>PyErrArguments</code></a>

until the <code>PyErr</code> is needed.</p>
<p>A final note is that any errors <code>E</code> which have a <code>From</code> conversion can be used with the <code>?</code>
(“try”) operator with them. An alternative implementation of the above <code>parse_int</code> which instead returns <code>PyResult</code> is below:</p>

<h2 id="foreign-rust-error-types"><a class="header" href="#foreign-rust-error-types">Foreign Rust error types</a></h2>
<p>The Rust compiler will not permit implementation of traits for types outside of the crate where the type is defined. (This is known as the “orphan rule”.)</p>
<p>Given a type <code>OtherError</code> which is defined in third-party code, there are two main strategies available to integrate it with PyO3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a newtype wrapper, e.g. <code>MyOtherError</code>. Then implement <code>From&lt;MyOtherError&gt; for PyErr</code> (or <code>PyErrArguments</code>), as well as <code>From&lt;OtherError&gt;</code> for <code>MyOtherError</code>.</li>
<li>Use Rust’s Result combinators such as <code>map_err</code> to write code freely to convert <code>OtherError</code> into whatever is needed. This requires boilerplate at every usage however gives unlimited flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>To detail the newtype strategy a little further, the key trick is to return <code>Result&lt;T, MyOtherError&gt;</code> from the <code>#[pyfunction]</code>. This means that PyO3 will make use of <code>From&lt;MyOtherError&gt; for PyErr</code> to create Python exceptions while the <code>#[pyfunction]</code> implementation can use <code>?</code> to convert <code>OtherError</code> to <code>MyOtherError</code> automatically.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates this for some imaginary third-party crate <code>some_crate</code> with a function <code>get_x</code> returning <code>Result&lt;i32, OtherError&gt;</code>:</p>

<p>PyO3 exposes a group of attributes powered by Rust’s proc macro system for defining Python classes as Rust structs.</p>
<p>The main attribute is <code>#[pyclass]</code>, which is placed upon a Rust <code>struct</code> or a fieldless <code>enum</code> (a.k.a. C-like enum) to generate a Python type for it. They will usually also have <em>one</em> <code>#[pymethods]</code>-annotated <code>impl</code> block for the struct, which is used to define Python methods and constants for the generated Python type. (If the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/features.html#multiple-pymethods"><code>multiple-pymethods</code></a> feature is enabled each <code>#[pyclass]</code> is allowed to have multiple <code>#[pymethods]</code> blocks.) <code>#[pymethods]</code> may also have implementations for Python magic methods such as <code>__str__</code>.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions"><a class="header" href="#restrictions">Restrictions</a></h3>
<p>To integrate Rust types with Python, PyO3 needs to place some restrictions on the types which can be annotated with <code>#[pyclass]</code>. In particular, they must have no lifetime parameters, no generic parameters, and must implement <code>Send</code>. The reason for each of these is explained below.</p>
<h4 id="no-lifetime-parameters"><a class="header" href="#no-lifetime-parameters">No lifetime parameters</a></h4>
<p>Rust lifetimes are used by the Rust compiler to reason about a program’s memory safety. They are a compile-time only concept; there is no way to access Rust lifetimes at runtime from a dynamic language like Python.</p>
<p>As soon as Rust data is exposed to Python, there is no guarantee which the Rust compiler can make on how long the data will live. Python is a reference-counted language and those references can be held for an arbitrarily long time which is untraceable by the Rust compiler. The only possible way to express this correctly is to require that any <code>#[pyclass]</code> does not borrow data for any lifetime shorter than the <code>'static</code> lifetime, i.e. the <code>#[pyclass]</code> cannot have any lifetime parameters.</p>
<p>When you need to share ownership of data between Python and Rust, instead of using borrowed references with lifetimes consider using reference-counted smart pointers such as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a> or <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Py.html"><code>Py</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="no-generic-parameters"><a class="header" href="#no-generic-parameters">No generic parameters</a></h4>
<p>A Rust <code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt;</code> with a generic parameter <code>T</code> generates new compiled implementations each time it is used with a different concrete type for <code>T</code>. These new implementations are generated by the compiler at each usage site. This is incompatible with wrapping <code>Foo</code> in Python, where there needs to be a single compiled implementation of <code>Foo</code> which is integrated with the Python interpreter.</p>
<h4 id="must-be-send"><a class="header" href="#must-be-send">Must be send</a></h4>
<p>Because Python objects are freely shared between threads by the Python interpreter, there is no guarantee which thread will eventually drop the object. Therefore all types annotated with <code>#[pyclass]</code> must implement <code>Send</code> (unless annotated with <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class.html#customizing-the-class"><code>#[pyclass(unsendable)]</code></a>).</p>
<h2 id="constructor-1"><a class="header" href="#constructor-1">Constructor</a></h2>
<p>By default it is not possible to create an instance of a custom class from Python code.
To declare a constructor, you need to define a method and annotate it with the <code>#[new]</code>
attribute. Only Python’s <code>__new__</code> method can be specified, <code>__init__</code> is not available.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

        Number(value)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if your <code>new</code> method may fail you can return <code>PyResult&lt;Self&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Rust method name is not important here; this way you can
still use <code>new()</code> for a Rust-level constructor.</p>

created from Rust, but not from Python.</p>

<p>You sometimes need to convert your <code>pyclass</code> into a Python object and access it
from Rust code (e.g., for testing it).
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/pycell/struct.PyCell.html"><code>PyCell</code></a> is the primary interface for that.</p>
<p><code>PyCell&lt;T: PyClass&gt;</code> is always allocated in the Python heap, so Rust doesn’t have ownership of it.
In other words, Rust code can only extract a <code>&amp;PyCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, not a <code>PyCell&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, to mutate data behind <code>&amp;PyCell</code> safely, PyO3 employs the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">Interior Mutability Pattern</a>
like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a>.</p>
<p>Users who are familiar with <code>RefCell</code> can use <code>PyCell</code> just like <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>For users who are not very familiar with <code>RefCell</code>, here is a reminder of Rust’s rules of borrowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time, you can have either (but not both of) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.</li>
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>PyCell</code>, like <code>RefCell</code>, ensures these borrowing rules by tracking references at runtime.</p>

<p>By default, <code>PyAny</code> is used as the base class. To override this default,
use the <code>extends</code> parameter for <code>pyclass</code> with the full path to the base class.</p>
<p>For convenience, <code>(T, U)</code> implements <code>Into&lt;PyClassInitializer&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> where <code>U</code> is the
baseclass of <code>T</code>.
But for more deeply nested inheritance, you have to return <code>PyClassInitializer&lt;T&gt;</code>
explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="object-properties"><a class="header" href="#object-properties">Object properties</a></h2>
<p>PyO3 supports two ways to add properties to your <code>#[pyclass]</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For simple struct fields with no side effects, a <code>#[pyo3(get, set)]</code> attribute can be added directly to the field definition in the <code>#[pyclass]</code>.</li>
<li>For properties which require computation you can define <code>#[getter]</code> and <code>#[setter]</code> functions in the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class.html#instance-methods"><code>#[pymethods]</code></a> block.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll cover each of these in the following sections.</p>
<h3 id="object-properties-using-pyo3get-set"><a class="header" href="#object-properties-using-pyo3get-set">Object properties using <code>#[pyo3(get, set)]</code></a></h3>
<p>For simple cases where a member variable is just read and written with no side effects, you can declare getters and setters in your <code>#[pyclass]</code> field definition using the <code>pyo3</code> attribute, like in the example below:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span>#[pyclass]
struct MyClass {
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    num: i32
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The above would make the <code>num</code> field available for reading and writing as a <code>self.num</code> Python property. To expose the property with a different name to the field, specify this alongside the rest of the options, e.g. <code>#[pyo3(get, set, name = &quot;custom_name&quot;)]</code>.</p>
<p>Properties can be readonly or writeonly by using just <code>#[pyo3(get)]</code> or <code>#[pyo3(set)]</code> respectively.</p>
<p>To use these annotations, your field type must implement some conversion traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>get</code> the field type must implement both <code>IntoPy&lt;PyObject&gt;</code> and <code>Clone</code>.</li>
<li>For <code>set</code> the field type must implement <code>FromPyObject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="object-properties-using-getter-and-setter"><a class="header" href="#object-properties-using-getter-and-setter">Object properties using <code>#[getter]</code> and <code>#[setter]</code></a></h3>
<p>For cases which don’t satisfy the <code>#[pyo3(get, set)]</code> trait requirements, or need side effects, descriptor methods can be defined in a <code>#[pymethods]</code> <code>impl</code> block.</p>
<p>This is done using the <code>#[getter]</code> and <code>#[setter]</code> attributes, like in the example below:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

#[pymethods]
impl MyClass {
    #[getter]
    fn num(&amp;self) -&gt; PyResult&lt;i32&gt; {
        Ok(self.num)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>A getter or setter’s function name is used as the property name by default. There are several
ways how to override the name.</p>
<p>If a function name starts with <code>get_</code> or <code>set_</code> for getter or setter respectively,
the descriptor name becomes the function name with this prefix removed. This is also useful in case of
Rust keywords like <code>type</code>
(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/module-system/raw-identifiers.html">raw identifiers</a>
can be used since Rust 2018).</p>

        Ok(())
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this case, a property <code>num</code> is defined and available from Python code as <code>self.num</code>.</p>
<p>Both the <code>#[getter]</code> and <code>#[setter]</code> attributes accept one parameter.
If this parameter is specified, it is used as the property name, i.e.</p>

<span class="boring">}

<p>In this case, the property <code>number</code> is defined and available from Python code as <code>self.number</code>.</p>
<p>Attributes defined by <code>#[setter]</code> or <code>#[pyo3(set)]</code> will always raise <code>AttributeError</code> on <code>del</code>
operations. Support for defining custom <code>del</code> behavior is tracked in

<h2 id="instance-methods"><a class="header" href="#instance-methods">Instance methods</a></h2>
<p>To define a Python compatible method, an <code>impl</code> block for your struct has to be annotated with the
<code>#[pymethods]</code> attribute. PyO3 generates Python compatible wrappers for all functions in this
block with some variations, like descriptors, class method static methods, etc.</p>
<p>Since Rust allows any number of <code>impl</code> blocks, you can easily split methods
between those accessible to Python (and Rust) and those accessible only to Rust. However to have multiple
<code>#[pymethods]</code>-annotated <code>impl</code> blocks for the same struct you must enable the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/features.html#multiple-pymethods"><code>multiple-pymethods</code></a> feature of PyO3.</p>

<span class="boring">}

<p>Calls to these methods are protected by the GIL, so both <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>&amp;mut self</code> can be used.
The return type must be <code>PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>T</code> for some <code>T</code> that implements <code>IntoPy&lt;PyObject&gt;</code>;
the latter is allowed if the method cannot raise Python exceptions.</p>
<p>A <code>Python</code> parameter can be specified as part of method signature, in this case the <code>py</code> argument

<p>The <code>#[pyclass]</code> macros rely on a lot of conditional code generation: each <code>#[pyclass]</code> can optionally have a <code>#[pymethods]</code> block.</p>
<p>To support this flexibility the <code>#[pyclass]</code> macro expands to a blob of boilerplate code which sets up the structure for <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/case-studies/blob/master/autoref-specialization/README.md">“dtolnay specialization”</a>. This implementation pattern enables the Rust compiler to use <code>#[pymethods]</code> implementations when they are present, and fall back to default (empty) definitions when they are not.</p>
<p>This simple technique works for the case when there is zero or one implementations. To support multiple <code>#[pymethods]</code> for a <code>#[pyclass]</code> (in the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/features.html#multiple-pymethods"><code>multiple-pymethods</code></a> feature), a registry mechanism provided by the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/inventory"><code>inventory</code></a> crate is used instead.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magic-methods-and-slots"><a class="header" href="#magic-methods-and-slots">Magic methods and slots</a></h1>
<p>Python’s object model defines several protocols for different object behavior, such as the sequence, mapping, and number protocols. You may be familiar with implementing these protocols in Python classes by “magic” methods, such as <code>__str__</code> or <code>__repr__</code>. Because of the double-underscores surrounding their name, these are also known as “dunder” methods.</p>
<p>In the Python C-API which PyO3 is implemented upon, many of these magic methods have to be placed into special “slots” on the class type object, as covered in the previous section.</p>
<p>If a function name in <code>#[pymethods]</code> is a recognised magic method, it will be automatically placed into the correct slot in the Python type object. The function name is taken from the usual rules for naming <code>#[pymethods]</code>: the <code>#[pyo3(name = &quot;...&quot;)]</code> attribute is used if present, otherwise the Rust function name is used.</p>
<p>The magic methods handled by PyO3 are very similar to the standard Python ones on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names">this page</a> - in particular they are the the subset which have slots as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">defined here</a>. Some of the slots do not have a magic method in Python, which leads to a few additional magic methods defined only in PyO3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic methods for garbage collection</li>
<li>Magic methods for the buffer protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>When PyO3 handles a magic method, a couple of changes apply compared to other <code>#[pymethods]</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>#[pyo3(text_signature = &quot;...&quot;)]</code> attribute is not allowed</li>
<li>The signature is restricted to match the magic method</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections list of all magic methods PyO3 currently handles.  The
given signatures should be interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All methods take a receiver as first argument, shown as <code>&lt;self&gt;</code>. It can be
<code>&amp;self</code>, <code>&amp;mut self</code> or a <code>PyCell</code> reference like <code>self_: PyRef&lt;'_, Self&gt;</code> and
<code>self_: PyRefMut&lt;'_, Self&gt;</code>, as described <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class/../class.html#inheritance">here</a>.</li>
<li>An optional <code>Python&lt;'py&gt;</code> argument is always allowed as the first argument.</li>
<li>Return values can be optionally wrapped in <code>PyResult</code>.</li>
<li><code>object</code> means that any type is allowed that can be extracted from a Python
object (if argument) or converted to a Python object (if return value).</li>
<li>Other types must match what’s given, e.g. <code>pyo3::basic::CompareOp</code> for
<code>__richcmp__</code>’s second argument.</li>
<li>For the comparison and arithmetic methods, extraction errors are not
propagated as exceptions, but lead to a return of <code>NotImplemented</code>.</li>
<li>For some magic methods, the return values are not restricted by PyO3, but

<summary>Disabling Python's default hash</summary>
By default, all `#[pyclass]` types have a default hash implementation from Python. Types which should not be hashable can override this by setting `__hash__` to `None`. This is the same mechanism as for a pure-Python class. This is done like so:
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span><span class="boring">

#[pymethods]

}

</span></code></pre></pre>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>__richcmp__(&lt;self&gt;, object, pyo3::basic::CompareOp) -&gt; object</code></p>
<p>Overloads Python comparison operations (<code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code>).
The <code>CompareOp</code> argument indicates the comparison operation being performed.</p>
<p><em>Note that implementing <code>__richcmp__</code> will cause Python not to generate a default <code>__hash__</code> implementation, so consider implementing <code>__hash__</code> when implementing <code>__richcmp__</code>.</em></p>
<details>
<summary>Return type</summary>
The return type will normally be `PyResult<bool>`, but any Python object can be returned.
If the second argument `object` is not of the type specified in the
signature, the generated code will automatically `return NotImplemented`.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/pyclass/enum.CompareOp.html#method.matches"><code>CompareOp::matches</code></a> to adapt a Rust <code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> result

<details>
<summary>Differences between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`</summary>
As in Python, `__getattr__` is only called if the attribute is not found
by normal attribute lookup.  `__getattribute__`, on the other hand, is
called for *every* attribute access.  If it wants to access existing
attributes on `self`, it needs to be very careful not to introduce
infinite recursion, and use `baseclass.__getattribute__()`.

<p>Overrides attribute access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>__bool__(&lt;self&gt;) -&gt; bool</code></p>
<p>Determines the “truthyness” of an object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>__call__(&lt;self&gt;, ...) -&gt; object</code> - here, any argument list can be defined
as for normal <code>pymethods</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iterable-objects"><a class="header" href="#iterable-objects">Iterable objects</a></h3>
<p>Iterators can be defined using these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__iter__(&lt;self&gt;) -&gt; object</code></li>
<li><code>__next__(&lt;self&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;object&gt; or IterNextOutput</code> (<a href="PyO3_guides/src/class/protocols.html#returning-a-value-from-iteration">see details</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Returning <code>None</code> from <code>__next__</code> indicates that that there are no further items.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

(i.e. the <em>iterable</em>) and the iterator it provides. In this case, the iterable

<p>This guide has so far shown how to use <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to implement yielding values
during iteration.  In Python a generator can also return a value. To express
this in Rust, PyO3 provides the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/class/iter/enum.IterNextOutput.html"><code>IterNextOutput</code></a> enum to both <code>Yield</code> values

</ul>
<h3 id="mapping--sequence-types"><a class="header" href="#mapping--sequence-types">Mapping &amp; Sequence types</a></h3>
<p>The magic methods in this section can be used to implement Python container types. They are two main categories of container in Python: “mappings” such as <code>dict</code>, with arbitrary keys, and “sequences” such as <code>list</code> and <code>tuple</code>, with integer keys.</p>
<p>The Python C-API which PyO3 is built upon has separate “slots” for sequences and mappings. When writing a <code>class</code> in pure Python, there is no such distinction in the implementation - a <code>__getitem__</code> implementation will fill the slots for both the mapping and sequence forms, for example.</p>
<p>By default PyO3 reproduces the Python behaviour of filling both mapping and sequence slots. This makes sense for the “simple” case which matches Python, and also for sequences, where the mapping slot is used anyway to implement slice indexing.</p>
<p>Mapping types usually will not want the sequence slots filled. Having them filled will lead to outcomes which may be unwanted, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mapping type will successfully cast to <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/types/struct.PySequence.html"><code>PySequence</code></a>. This may lead to consumers of the type handling it incorrectly.</li>
<li>Python provides a default implementation of <code>__iter__</code> for sequences, which calls <code>__getitem__</code> with consecutive positive integers starting from 0 until an <code>IndexError</code> is returned. Unless the mapping only contains consecutive positive integer keys, this <code>__iter__</code> implementation will likely not be the intended behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <code>#[pyclass(mapping)]</code> annotation to instruct PyO3 to only fill the mapping slots, leaving the sequence ones empty. This will apply to <code>__getitem__</code>, <code>__setitem__</code>, and <code>__delitem__</code>.</p>
<p>Use the <code>#[pyclass(sequence)]</code> annotation to instruct PyO3 to fill the <code>sq_length</code> slot instead of the <code>mp_length</code> slot for <code>__len__</code>. This will help libraries such as <code>numpy</code> recognise the class as a sequence, however will also cause CPython to automatically add the sequence length to any negative indices before passing them to <code>__getitem__</code>. (<code>__getitem__</code>, <code>__setitem__</code> and <code>__delitem__</code> mapping slots are still used for sequences, for slice operations.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>__len__(&lt;self&gt;) -&gt; usize</code></p>
<p>Implements the built-in function <code>len()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>__contains__(&lt;self&gt;, object) -&gt; bool</code></p>
<p>Implements membership test operators.
Should return true if <code>item</code> is in <code>self</code>, false otherwise.
For objects that don’t define <code>__contains__()</code>, the membership test simply
traverses the sequence until it finds a match.</p>

<p>If your type owns references to other Python objects, you will need to integrate

do this, implement the two methods <code>__traverse__</code> and <code>__clear__</code>.  These
correspond to the slots <code>tp_traverse</code> and <code>tp_clear</code> in the Python C API.
<code>__traverse__</code> must call <code>visit.call()</code> for each reference to another Python
object.  <code>__clear__</code> must clear out any mutable references to other Python
objects (thus breaking reference cycles). Immutable references do not have to be
cleared, as every cycle must contain at least one mutable reference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When implementing <code>__hash__</code> and comparisons, it is important that the following property holds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">k1 == k2 -&gt; hash(k1) == hash(k2)
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must also be equal. In addition you must take
care that your classes’ hash doesn’t change during its lifetime. In this tutorial we do that by not
letting Python code change our <code>Number</code> class. In other words, it is immutable.</p>
<p>By default, all <code>#[pyclass]</code> types have a default hash implementation from Python.
Types which should not be hashable can override this by setting <code>__hash__</code> to None.
This is the same mechanism as for a pure-Python class. This is done like so:</p>

<h3 id="comparisons"><a class="header" href="#comparisons">Comparisons</a></h3>
<p>Unlike in Python, PyO3 does not provide the magic comparison methods you might expect like <code>__eq__</code>,
<code>__lt__</code> and so on. Instead you have to implement all six operations at once with <code>__richcmp__</code>.
This method will be called with a value of <code>CompareOp</code> depending on the operation.</p>

<p>At this point we have a <code>Number</code> class that we can’t actually do any math on!</p>
<p>Before proceeding, we should think about how we want to handle overflows. There are three obvious solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can have infinite precision just like Python’s <code>int</code>. However that would be quite boring - we’d
be reinventing the wheel.</li>
<li>We can raise exceptions whenever <code>Number</code> overflows, but that makes the API painful to use.</li>
<li>We can wrap around the boundary of <code>i32</code>. This is the approach we’ll take here. To do that we’ll just forward to <code>i32</code>’s
<code>wrapping_*</code> methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixing-our-constructor"><a class="header" href="#fixing-our-constructor">Fixing our constructor</a></h3>
<p>Let’s address the first overflow, in <code>Number</code>’s constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from my_module import Number

n = Number(1 &lt;&lt; 1337)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;example.py&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    n = Number(1 &lt;&lt; 1337)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of relying on the default <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/conversion/trait.FromPyObject.html"><code>FromPyObject</code></a> extraction to parse arguments, we can specify our
own extraction function, using the <code>#[pyo3(from_py_with = &quot;...&quot;)]</code> attribute. Unfortunately PyO3
doesn’t provide a way to wrap Python integers out of the box, but we can do a Python call to mask it
and cast it to an <code>i32</code>.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-writing-some-unsafe-code"><a class="header" href="#appendix-writing-some-unsafe-code">Appendix: Writing some unsafe code</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter we said that PyO3 doesn’t provide a way to wrap Python integers out
of the box but that’s a half truth. There’s not a PyO3 API for it, but there’s a Python C API
function that does:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">unsigned long PyLong_AsUnsignedLongMask(PyObject *obj)
</code></pre>
<p>We can call this function from Rust by using <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/ffi/fn.PyLong_AsUnsignedLongMask.html"><code>pyo3::ffi::PyLong_AsUnsignedLongMask</code></a>. This is an <em>unsafe</em>
function, which means we have to use an unsafe block to call it and take responsibility for upholding
the contracts of this function. Let’s review those contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GIL must be held. If it’s not, calling this function causes a data race.</li>
<li>The pointer must be valid, i.e. it must be properly aligned and point to a valid Python object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s create that helper function. The signature has to be <code>fn(&amp;PyAny) -&gt; PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;PyAny</code> represents a checked borrowed reference, so the pointer derived from it is valid (and not null).</li>
<li>Whenever we have borrowed references to Python objects in scope, it is guaranteed that the GIL is held. This reference is also where we can get a <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/struct.Python.html"><code>Python</code></a> token to use in our call to <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/prelude/struct.PyErr.html#method.take"><code>PyErr::take</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Classes can be callable if they have a <code>#[pymethod]</code> named <code>__call__</code>.
This allows instances of a class to behave similar to functions.</p>
<p>This method’s signature must look like <code>__call__(&lt;self&gt;, ...) -&gt; object</code> - here,
any argument list can be defined as for normal pymethods</p>
<h3 id="example-implementing-a-call-counter"><a class="header" href="#example-implementing-a-call-counter">Example: Implementing a call counter</a></h3>
<p>The following pyclass is a basic decorator - its constructor takes a Python object
as argument and calls that object when called. An equivalent Python implementation
is linked at the end.</p>
<p>An example crate containing this pyclass can be found <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/tree/main/examples/decorator">here</a></p>

say_hello has been called 2 time(s).

hello
say_hello has been called 4 time(s).
hello
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pure-python-implementation"><a class="header" href="#pure-python-implementation">Pure Python implementation</a></h3>
<p>A Python implementation of this looks similar to the Rust version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Counter:
    def __init__(self, wraps):
        self.count = 0
        self.wraps = wraps

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.count += 1
        print(f&quot;{self.wraps.__name__} has been called {self.count} time(s)&quot;)
        self.wraps(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it can also be implemented as a higher order function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def Counter(wraps):
    count = 0
    def call(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print(f&quot;{wraps.__name__} has been called {count} time(s)&quot;)
        return wraps(*args, **kwargs)
    return call
</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-is-the-cell-for"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-cell-for">What is the <code>Cell</code> for?</a></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/discussions/2598" title="Thread Safe Decorator &lt;Help Wanted&gt; · Discussion #2598 · PyO3/pyo3">previous implementation</a> used a normal <code>u64</code>, which meant it required a <code>&amp;mut self</code> receiver to update the count:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[pyo3(signature = (*args, **kwargs))]
fn __call__(&amp;mut self, py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, args: &amp;PyTuple, kwargs: Option&lt;&amp;PyDict&gt;) -&gt; PyResult&lt;Py&lt;PyAny&gt;&gt; {
    self.count += 1;
    let name = self.wraps.getattr(py, &quot;__name__&quot;)?;

    println!(&quot;{} has been called {} time(s).&quot;, name, self.count);

    // After doing something, we finally forward the call to the wrapped function
    let ret = self.wraps.call(py, args, kwargs)?;

    // We could do something with the return value of
    // the function before returning it
    Ok(ret)
}
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this is that the <code>&amp;mut self</code> receiver means PyO3 has to borrow it exclusively,
and hold this borrow across the<code>self.wraps.call(py, args, kwargs)</code> call. This call returns control to the user’s Python code
which is free to call arbitrary things, <em>including</em> the decorated function. If that happens PyO3 is unable to create a second unique borrow and will be forced to raise an exception.</p>
<p>As a result, something innocent like this will raise an exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@Counter
def say_hello():
    if say_hello.count &lt; 2:
        print(f&quot;hello from decorator&quot;)

say_hello()
# RuntimeError: Already borrowed
</code></pre>
<p>The implementation in this chapter fixes that by never borrowing exclusively; all the methods take <code>&amp;self</code> as receivers, of which multiple may exist simultaneously. This requires a shared counter and the easiest way to do that is to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html" title="Cell in std::cell - Rust"><code>Cell</code></a>, so that’s what is used here.</p>
<p>This shows the dangers of running arbitrary Python code - note that “running arbitrary Python code” can be far more subtle than the example above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python’s asynchronous executor may park the current thread in the middle of Python code, even in Python code that <em>you</em> control, and let other Python code run.</li>
<li>Dropping arbitrary Python objects may invoke destructors defined in Python (<code>__del__</code> methods).</li>
<li>Calling Python’s C-api (most PyO3 apis call C-api functions internally) may raise exceptions, which may allow Python code in signal handlers to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is especially important if you are writing unsafe code; Python code must never be able to cause undefined behavior. You must ensure that your Rust code is in a consistent state before doing any of the above things.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="type-conversions"><a class="header" href="#type-conversions">Type conversions</a></h1>
<p>In this portion of the guide we’ll talk about the mapping of Python types to Rust types offered by PyO3, as well as the traits available to perform conversions between them.</p>

<p>When writing functions callable from Python (such as a <code>#[pyfunction]</code> or in a <code>#[pymethods]</code> block), the trait <code>FromPyObject</code> is required for function arguments, and <code>IntoPy&lt;PyObject&gt;</code> is required for function return values.</p>

<h3 id="argument-types"><a class="header" href="#argument-types">Argument Types</a></h3>
<p>When accepting a function argument, it is possible to either use Rust library types or PyO3’s Python-native types. (See the next section for discussion on when to use each.)</p>

<h4 id="using-rust-library-types-vs-python-native-types"><a class="header" href="#using-rust-library-types-vs-python-native-types">Using Rust library types vs Python-native types</a></h4>
<p>Using Rust library types as function arguments will incur a conversion cost compared to using the Python-native types. Using the Python-native types is almost zero-cost (they just require a type check similar to the Python builtin function <code>isinstance()</code>).</p>
<p>However, once that conversion cost has been paid, the Rust standard library types offer a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can write functionality in native-speed Rust code (free of Python’s runtime costs).</li>
<li>You get better interoperability with the rest of the Rust ecosystem.</li>
<li>You can use <code>Python::allow_threads</code> to release the Python GIL and let other Python threads make progress while your Rust code is executing.</li>
<li>You also benefit from stricter type checking. For example you can specify <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, which will only accept a Python <code>list</code> containing integers. The Python-native equivalent, <code>&amp;PyList</code>, would accept a Python <code>list</code> containing Python objects of any type.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most PyO3 usage the conversion cost is worth paying to get these benefits. As always, if you’re not sure it’s worth it in your case, benchmark it!</p>
<h3 id="returning-rust-values-to-python"><a class="header" href="#returning-rust-values-to-python">Returning Rust values to Python</a></h3>
<p>When returning values from functions callable from Python, Python-native types (<code>&amp;PyAny</code>, <code>&amp;PyDict</code> etc.) can be used with zero cost.</p>
<p>Because these types are references, in some situations the Rust compiler may ask for lifetime annotations. If this is the case, you should use <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code>, <code>Py&lt;PyDict&gt;</code> etc. instead - which are also zero-cost. For all of these Python-native types <code>T</code>, <code>Py&lt;T&gt;</code> can be created from <code>T</code> with an <code>.into()</code> conversion.</p>
<p>If your function is fallible, it should return <code>PyResult&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where <code>E</code> implements <code>From&lt;E&gt; for PyErr</code>. This will raise a <code>Python</code> exception if the <code>Err</code> variant is returned.</p>
<p>Finally, the following Rust types are also able to convert to Python as return values:</p>

and <a href="PyO3_guides/src/conversions/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/pycell/struct.PyRefMut.html"><code>PyRefMut</code></a>.  They work like the reference wrappers of
<code>std::cell::RefCell</code> and ensure (at runtime) that Rust borrows are allowed.</p>

<p>This trait defines the to-python conversion for a Rust type. It is usually implemented as

<p>This chapter of the guide documents some ways to interact with Python code from Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to call Python functions</li>
<li>How to execute existing Python code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calling-python-functions"><a class="header" href="#calling-python-functions">Calling Python functions</a></h2>
<p>Any Python-native object reference (such as <code>&amp;PyAny</code>, <code>&amp;PyList</code>, or <code>&amp;PyCell&lt;MyClass&gt;</code>) can be used to call Python functions.</p>
<p>PyO3 offers two APIs to make function calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call"><code>call</code></a> - call any callable Python object.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call_method"><code>call_method</code></a> - call a method on the Python object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these APIs take <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> arguments (for positional and keyword arguments respectively). There are variants for less complex calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call1"><code>call1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call_method1"><code>call_method1</code></a> to call only with positional <code>args</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call0"><code>call0</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/0.12.3/pyo3/struct.PyAny.html#method.call_method0"><code>call_method0</code></a> to call with no arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/types.html#pyt-and-pyobject"><code>Py&lt;T&gt;</code></a> smart pointer also exposes these same six API methods, but needs a <code>Python</code> token as an additional first argument to prove the GIL is held.</p>
<p>The example below calls a Python function behind a <code>PyObject</code> (aka <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code>) reference:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::PyTuple;

fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    let arg1 = &quot;arg1&quot;;
    let arg2 = &quot;arg2&quot;;
    let arg3 = &quot;arg3&quot;;

    Python::with_gil(|py| {
        let fun: Py&lt;PyAny&gt; = PyModule::from_code(
            py,
            &quot;def example(*args, **kwargs):
                if args != ():
                    print('called with args', args)
                if kwargs != {}:
                    print('called with kwargs', kwargs)
                if args == () and kwargs == {}:
                    print('called with no arguments')&quot;,
            &quot;&quot;,
            &quot;&quot;,
        )?.getattr(&quot;example&quot;)?.into();

        // call object without any arguments
        fun.call0(py)?;

        // call object with PyTuple
        let args = PyTuple::new(py, &amp;[arg1, arg2, arg3]);
        fun.call1(py, args)?;

        // pass arguments as rust tuple
        let args = (arg1, arg2, arg3);
        fun.call1(py, args)?;
        Ok(())
    })
}
</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="creating-keyword-arguments"><a class="header" href="#creating-keyword-arguments">Creating keyword arguments</a></h3>
<p>For the <code>call</code> and <code>call_method</code> APIs, <code>kwargs</code> can be <code>None</code> or <code>Some(&amp;PyDict)</code>.

<p>On first glance, PyO3 provides a huge number of different types that can be used
to wrap or refer to Python objects.  This page delves into the details and gives
an overview of their intended meaning, with examples when each type is best
used.</p>
<h2 id="mutability-and-rust-types"><a class="header" href="#mutability-and-rust-types">Mutability and Rust types</a></h2>
<p>Since Python has no concept of ownership, and works solely with boxed objects,
any Python object can be referenced any number of times, and mutation is allowed
from any reference.</p>
<p>The situation is helped a little by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which
ensures that only one thread can use the Python interpreter and its API at the
same time, while non-Python operations (system calls and extension code) can
unlock the GIL.  (See <a href="PyO3_guides/src/parallelism.html">the section on parallelism</a> for how to do
that in PyO3.)</p>
<p>In PyO3, holding the GIL is modeled by acquiring a token of the type
<code>Python&lt;'py&gt;</code>, which serves three purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides some global API for the Python interpreter, such as
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.eval"><code>eval</code></a>.</li>
<li>It can be passed to functions that require a proof of holding the GIL,
such as <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Py.html#method.clone_ref"><code>Py::clone_ref</code></a>.</li>
<li>Its lifetime can be used to create Rust references that implicitly guarantee
holding the GIL, such as <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/types/struct.PyAny.html"><code>&amp;'py PyAny</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two points are the reason why some APIs in PyO3 require the <code>py: Python</code> argument, while others don’t.</p>
<p>The PyO3 API for Python objects is written such that instead of requiring a
mutable Rust reference for mutating operations such as
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/types/struct.PyList.html#method.append"><code>PyList::append</code></a>, a shared reference (which, in turn, can only
be created through <code>Python&lt;'_&gt;</code> with a GIL lifetime) is sufficient.</p>
<p>However, Rust structs wrapped as Python objects (called <code>pyclass</code> types) usually
<em>do</em> need <code>&amp;mut</code> access.  Due to the GIL, PyO3 <em>can</em> guarantee thread-safe acces
to them, but it cannot statically guarantee uniqueness of <code>&amp;mut</code> references once
an object’s ownership has been passed to the Python interpreter, ensuring
references is done at runtime using <code>PyCell</code>, a scheme very similar to
<code>std::cell::RefCell</code>.</p>
<h2 id="object-types"><a class="header" href="#object-types">Object types</a></h2>
<h3 id="pyany"><a class="header" href="#pyany"><a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/types/struct.PyAny.html"><code>PyAny</code></a></a></h3>
<p><strong>Represents:</strong> a Python object of unspecified type, restricted to a GIL
lifetime.  Currently, <code>PyAny</code> can only ever occur as a reference, <code>&amp;PyAny</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Used:</strong> Whenever you want to refer to some Python object and will have the
GIL for the whole duration you need to access that object. For example,
intermediate values and arguments to <code>pyfunction</code>s or <code>pymethod</code>s implemented
in Rust where any type is allowed.</p>
<p>Many general methods for interacting with Python objects are on the <code>PyAny</code> struct,
such as <code>getattr</code>, <code>setattr</code>, and <code>.call</code>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="parallelism"><a class="header" href="#parallelism">Parallelism</a></h1>
<p>CPython has the infamous <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>, which prevents several threads from executing Python bytecode in parallel. This makes threading in Python a bad fit for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/">CPU-bound</a> tasks and often forces developers to accept the overhead of multiprocessing.</p>
<p>In PyO3 parallelism can be easily achieved in Rust-only code. Let’s take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/blob/main/examples/word-count/src/lib.rs">word-count</a> example, where we have a <code>search</code> function that utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> crate to count words in parallel.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">#![allow(dead_code)]
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;

// These traits let us use `par_lines` and `map`.
use rayon::str::ParallelString;
use rayon::iter::ParallelIterator;

/// Count the occurrences of needle in line, case insensitive
fn count_line(line: &amp;str, needle: &amp;str) -&gt; usize {
    let mut total = 0;
    for word in line.split(' ') {
        if word == needle {
            total += 1;
        }
    }
    total
}

#[pyfunction]
fn search(contents: &amp;str, needle: &amp;str) -&gt; usize {
    contents
        .par_lines()
        .map(|line| count_line(line, needle))
        .sum()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But let’s assume you have a long running Rust function which you would like to execute several times in parallel. For the sake of example let’s take a sequential version of the word count:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">#![allow(dead_code)]

</span><span class="boring">    for word in line.split(' ') {
</span><span class="boring">        if word == needle {
</span><span class="boring">            total += 1;

</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">    total
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">

    contents.lines().map(|line| count_line(line, needle)).sum()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To enable parallel execution of this function, the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.allow_threads"><code>Python::allow_threads</code></a> method can be used to temporarily release the GIL, thus allowing other Python threads to run. We then have a function exposed to the Python runtime which calls <code>search_sequential</code> inside a closure passed to <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.allow_threads"><code>Python::allow_threads</code></a> to enable true parallelism:</p>

<p>Now Python threads can use more than one CPU core, resolving the limitation which usually makes multi-threading in Python only good for IO-bound tasks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from word_count import search_sequential_allow_threads

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)

future_1 = executor.submit(
    word_count.search_sequential_allow_threads, contents, needle
)
future_2 = executor.submit(
    word_count.search_sequential_allow_threads, contents, needle
)
result_1 = future_1.result()
result_2 = future_2.result()

<h2 id="benchmark"><a class="header" href="#benchmark">Benchmark</a></h2>
<p>Let’s benchmark the <code>word-count</code> example to verify that we really did unlock parallelism with PyO3.</p>

<h2 id="macros-1"><a class="header" href="#macros-1">Macros</a></h2>
<p>PyO3’s attributes (<code>#[pyclass]</code>, <code>#[pymodule]</code>, etc.) are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">procedural macros</a>, which means that they rewrite the source of the annotated item. You can view the generated source with the following command, which also expands a few other things:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo rustc --profile=check -- -Z unstable-options --pretty=expanded &gt; expanded.rs; rustfmt expanded.rs
</code></pre>
<p>(You might need to install <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt">rustfmt</a> if you don’t already have it.)</p>
<p>You can also debug classic <code>!</code>-macros by adding <code>-Z trace-macros</code>:</p>

<h2 id="running-with-valgrind"><a class="header" href="#running-with-valgrind">Running with Valgrind</a></h2>
<p>Valgrind is a tool to detect memory management bugs such as memory leaks.</p>
<p>You first need to install a debug build of Python, otherwise Valgrind won’t produce usable results. In Ubuntu there’s e.g. a <code>python3-dbg</code> package.</p>
<p>Activate an environment with the debug interpreter and recompile. If you’re on Linux, use <code>ldd</code> with the name of your binary and check that you’re linking e.g. <code>libpython3.7d.so.1.0</code> instead of <code>libpython3.7.so.1.0</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python/cpython/master/Misc/valgrind-python.supp">Download the suppressions file for cpython</a>.</p>
<p>Run Valgrind with <code>valgrind --suppressions=valgrind-python.supp ./my-command --with-options</code></p>
<h2 id="getting-a-stacktrace"><a class="header" href="#getting-a-stacktrace">Getting a stacktrace</a></h2>
<p>The best start to investigate a crash such as an segmentation fault is a backtrace. You can set <code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code> as an environment variable to get the stack trace on a <code>panic!</code>. Alternatively you can use a debugger such as <code>gdb</code> to explore the issue. Rust provides a wrapper, <code>rust-gdb</code>, which has pretty-printers for inspecting Rust variables. Since PyO3 uses <code>cdylib</code> for Python shared objects, it does not receive the pretty-print debug hooks in <code>rust-gdb</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96365">rust-lang/rust#96365</a>). The mentioned issue contains a workaround for enabling pretty-printers in this case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link against a debug build of python as described in the previous chapter</li>
<li>Run <code>rust-gdb &lt;my-binary&gt;</code></li>
<li>Set a breakpoint (<code>b</code>) on <code>rust_panic</code> if you are investigating a <code>panic!</code></li>
<li>Enter <code>r</code> to run</li>
<li>After the crash occurred, enter <code>bt</code> or <code>bt full</code> to print the stacktrace</li>
</ul>
<p>Often it is helpful to run a small piece of Python code to exercise a section of Rust.</p>

<p>PyO3 provides a number of Cargo features to customise functionality. This chapter of the guide provides detail on each of them.</p>
<p>By default, only the <code>macros</code> feature is enabled.</p>
<h2 id="features-for-extension-module-authors"><a class="header" href="#features-for-extension-module-authors">Features for extension module authors</a></h2>
<h3 id="extension-module"><a class="header" href="#extension-module"><code>extension-module</code></a></h3>
<p>This feature is required when building a Python extension module using PyO3.</p>
<p>It tells PyO3’s build script to skip linking against <code>libpython.so</code> on Unix platforms, where this must not be done.</p>
<p>See the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#linking">building and distribution</a> section for further detail.</p>
<h3 id="abi3"><a class="header" href="#abi3"><code>abi3</code></a></h3>
<p>This feature is used when building Python extension modules to create wheels which are compatible with multiple Python versions.</p>
<p>It restricts PyO3’s API to a subset of the full Python API which is guaranteed by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/">PEP 384</a> to be forwards-compatible with future Python versions.</p>
<p>See the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#py_limited_apiabi3">building and distribution</a> section for further detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-abi3-pyxy-features"><a class="header" href="#the-abi3-pyxy-features">The <code>abi3-pyXY</code> features</a></h3>
<p>(<code>abi3-py37</code>, <code>abi3-py38</code>, <code>abi3-py39</code>, and <code>abi3-py310</code>)</p>
<p>These features are extensions of the <code>abi3</code> feature to specify the exact minimum Python version which the multiple-version-wheel will support.</p>
<p>See the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#minimum-python-version-for-abi3">building and distribution</a> section for further detail.</p>
<h3 id="generate-import-lib"><a class="header" href="#generate-import-lib"><code>generate-import-lib</code></a></h3>
<p>This experimental feature is used to generate import libraries for Python DLL
for MinGW-w64 and MSVC (cross-)compile targets.</p>
<p>Enabling it allows to (cross-)compile extension modules to any Windows targets
without having to install the Windows Python distribution files for the target.</p>
<p>See the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#building-abi3-extensions-without-a-python-interpreter">building and distribution</a>

<h3 id="auto-initialize"><a class="header" href="#auto-initialize"><code>auto-initialize</code></a></h3>
<p>This feature changes <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.with_gil"><code>Python::with_gil</code></a> and <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.acquire_gil"><code>Python::acquire_gil</code></a> to automatically initialize a Python interpreter (by calling <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/fn.prepare_freethreaded_python.html"><code>prepare_freethreaded_python</code></a>) if needed.</p>
<p>If you do not enable this feature, you should call <code>pyo3::prepare_freethreaded_python()</code> before attempting to call any other Python APIs.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-features-1"><a class="header" href="#advanced-features-1">Advanced Features</a></h2>
<h3 id="macros-2"><a class="header" href="#macros-2"><code>macros</code></a></h3>
<p>This feature enables a dependency on the <code>pyo3-macros</code> crate, which provides the procedural macros portion of PyO3’s API:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[pymodule]</code></li>
<li><code>#[pyfunction]</code></li>
<li><code>#[pyclass]</code></li>
<li><code>#[pymethods]</code></li>
<li><code>#[derive(FromPyObject)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It also provides the <code>py_run!</code> macro.</p>
<p>These macros require a number of dependencies which may not be needed by users who just need PyO3 for Python FFI. Disabling this feature enables faster builds for those users, as these dependencies will not be built if this feature is disabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature is enabled by default. To disable it, set <code>default-features = false</code> for the <code>pyo3</code> entry in your Cargo.toml.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="multiple-pymethods"><a class="header" href="#multiple-pymethods"><code>multiple-pymethods</code></a></h3>
<p>This feature enables a dependency on <code>inventory</code>, which enables each <code>#[pyclass]</code> to have more than one <code>#[pymethods]</code> block. This feature also requires a minimum Rust version of 1.62 due to limitations in the <code>inventory</code> crate.</p>
<p>Most users should only need a single <code>#[pymethods]</code> per <code>#[pyclass]</code>. In addition, not all platforms (e.g. Wasm) are supported by <code>inventory</code>. For this reason this feature is not enabled by default, meaning fewer dependencies and faster compilation for the majority of users.</p>
<p>See <a href="PyO3_guides/src/class.html#implementation-details">the <code>#[pyclass]</code> implementation details</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="nightly"><a class="header" href="#nightly"><code>nightly</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>nightly</code> feature needs the nightly Rust compiler. This allows PyO3 to use the auto_traits and negative_impls features to fix the <code>Python::allow_threads</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="resolve-config"><a class="header" href="#resolve-config"><code>resolve-config</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>resolve-config</code> feature of the <code>pyo3-build-config</code> crate controls whether that crate’s
build script automatically resolves a Python interpreter / build configuration. This feature is primarily useful when building PyO3
itself. By default this feature is not enabled, meaning you can freely use <code>pyo3-build-config</code> as a standalone library to read or write PyO3 build configuration files or resolve metadata about a Python interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="optional-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#optional-dependencies">Optional Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>These features enable conversions between Python types and types from other Rust crates, enabling easy access to the rest of the Rust ecosystem.</p>

a strict memory model with concepts of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes,
where memory is freed at predictable points in program execution.  Python has
a looser memory model in which variables are reference-counted with shared,
mutable state by default. A global interpreter lock (GIL) is needed to prevent
race conditions, and a garbage collector is needed to break reference cycles.
Memory in Python is freed eventually by the garbage collector, but not usually
in a predictable way.</p>
<p>PyO3 bridges the Rust and Python memory models with two different strategies for
accessing memory allocated on Python’s heap from inside Rust.  These are
GIL-bound, or “owned” references, and GIL-independent <code>Py&lt;Any&gt;</code> smart pointers.</p>
<h2 id="gil-bound-memory"><a class="header" href="#gil-bound-memory">GIL-bound memory</a></h2>
<p>PyO3’s GIL-bound, “owned references” (<code>&amp;PyAny</code> etc.) make PyO3 more ergonomic to
use by ensuring that their lifetime can never be longer than the duration the
Python GIL is held.  This means that most of PyO3’s API can assume the GIL is
held. (If PyO3 could not assume this, every PyO3 API would need to take a
<code>Python</code> GIL token to prove that the GIL is held.)  This allows us to write
very simple and easy-to-understand programs like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::types::PyString;
</span><span class="boring">fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
</span>Python::with_gil(|py| -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    let hello: &amp;PyString = py.eval(&quot;\&quot;Hello World!\&quot;&quot;, None, None)?.extract()?;
    println!(&quot;Python says: {}&quot;, hello);
    Ok(())
})?;
<span class="boring">Ok(())
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Internally, calling <code>Python::with_gil()</code> or <code>Python::acquire_gil()</code> creates a
<code>GILPool</code> which owns the memory pointed to by the reference.  In the example
above, the lifetime of the reference <code>hello</code> is bound to the <code>GILPool</code>.  When
the <code>with_gil()</code> closure ends or the <code>GILGuard</code> from <code>acquire_gil()</code> is dropped,
the <code>GILPool</code> is also dropped and the Python reference counts of the variables
it owns are decreased, releasing them to the Python garbage collector.  Most
of the time we don’t have to think about this, but consider the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::types::PyString;
</span><span class="boring">fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
</span>Python::with_gil(|py| -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let hello: &amp;PyString = py.eval(&quot;\&quot;Hello World!\&quot;&quot;, None, None)?.extract()?;
        println!(&quot;Python says: {}&quot;, hello);
    }
    // There are 10 copies of `hello` on Python's heap here.
    Ok(())
})?;
<span class="boring">Ok(())
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We might assume that the <code>hello</code> variable’s memory is freed at the end of each
loop iteration, but in fact we create 10 copies of <code>hello</code> on Python’s heap.
This may seem surprising at first, but it is completely consistent with Rust’s
memory model.  The <code>hello</code> variable is dropped at the end of each loop, but it
is only a reference to the memory owned by the <code>GILPool</code>, and its lifetime is
bound to the <code>GILPool</code>, not the for loop.  The <code>GILPool</code> isn’t dropped until
the end of the <code>with_gil()</code> closure, at which point the 10 copies of <code>hello</code>
are finally released to the Python garbage collector.</p>
<p>In general we don’t want unbounded memory growth during loops!  One workaround
is to acquire and release the GIL with each iteration of the loop.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::types::PyString;
</span><span class="boring">fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {

        println!(&quot;Python says: {}&quot;, hello);
        Ok(())
    })?; // only one copy of `hello` at a time
}
<span class="boring">Ok(())
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>It might not be practical or performant to acquire and release the GIL so many
times.  Another workaround is to work with the <code>GILPool</code> object directly, but
this is unsafe.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;

<p>The unsafe method <code>Python::new_pool</code> allows you to create a nested <code>GILPool</code>
from which you can retrieve a new <code>py: Python</code> GIL token.  Variables created
with this new GIL token are bound to the nested <code>GILPool</code> and will be released
when the nested <code>GILPool</code> is dropped.  Here, the nested <code>GILPool</code> is dropped
at the end of each loop iteration, before the <code>with_gil()</code> closure ends.</p>
<p>When doing this, you must be very careful to ensure that once the <code>GILPool</code> is
dropped you do not retain access to any owned references created after the
<code>GILPool</code> was created.  Read the
<a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/prelude/struct.Python.html#method.new_pool">documentation for <code>Python::new_pool()</code></a>
for more information on safety.</p>
<h2 id="gil-independent-memory"><a class="header" href="#gil-independent-memory">GIL-independent memory</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we need a reference to memory on Python’s heap that can outlive the
GIL.  Python’s <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code> is analogous to <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, but for variables whose
memory is allocated on Python’s heap.  Cloning a <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code> increases its
internal reference count just like cloning <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>.  The smart pointer can
outlive the GIL from which it was created.  It isn’t magic, though.  We need to
reacquire the GIL to access the memory pointed to by the <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>What happens to the memory when the last <code>Py&lt;PyAny&gt;</code> is dropped and its
reference count reaches zero?  It depends whether or not we are holding the GIL.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::types::PyString;
</span><span class="boring">fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {

</span><span class="boring">}

<p>At the end of the <code>Python::with_gil()</code> closure <code>hello</code> is dropped, and then the
GIL is dropped.  Since <code>hello</code> is dropped while the GIL is still held by the
current thread, its memory is released to the Python garbage collector
immediately.</p>
<p>This example wasn’t very interesting.  We could have just used a GIL-bound
<code>&amp;PyString</code> reference.  What happens when the last <code>Py&lt;Any&gt;</code> is dropped while
we are <em>not</em> holding the GIL?</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;

// Do some stuff...
// Now sometime later in the program we want to access `hello`.
Python::with_gil(|py| {
    println!(&quot;Python says: {}&quot;, hello.as_ref(py));
});
// Now we're done with `hello`.
drop(hello); // Memory *not* released here.
// Sometime later we need the GIL again for something...
Python::with_gil(|py|
    // Memory for `hello` is released here.
<span class="boring">()
</span>);
<span class="boring">Ok(())
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When <code>hello</code> is dropped <em>nothing</em> happens to the pointed-to memory on Python’s
heap because nothing <em>can</em> happen if we’re not holding the GIL.  Fortunately,
the memory isn’t leaked.  PyO3 keeps track of the memory internally and will
release it the next time we acquire the GIL.</p>
<p>We can avoid the delay in releasing memory if we are careful to drop the
<code>Py&lt;Any&gt;</code> while the GIL is held.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;

    drop(hello); // Memory released here.
});
<span class="boring">Ok(())
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We could also have used <code>Py::into_ref()</code>, which consumes <code>self</code>, instead of
<code>Py::as_ref()</code>.  But note that in addition to being slower than <code>as_ref()</code>,
<code>into_ref()</code> binds the memory to the lifetime of the <code>GILPool</code>, which means
that rather than being released immediately, the memory will not be released
until the GIL is dropped.</p>

<p>This chapter of the guide goes into detail on how to build and distribute projects using PyO3. </p>
<ol>
<li>The way to achieve this is very different depending on whether:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the project is a Python module implemented in Rust</li>
<li>or a Rust binary embedding Python. </li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>For both types of project there are also common problems such as the Python version to build for and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a> arguments to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The material in this chapter is intended for users who have already read the PyO3 <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#index.md">README</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It covers in turn the choices that can be made for Python modules and for Rust binaries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a section at the end about cross-compiling projects using PyO3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an additional sub-chapter dedicated to <a href="PyO3_guides/src/./building_and_distribution/multiple_python_versions.html">supporting multiple Python versions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="basic-info"><a class="header" href="#basic-info">Basic Info</a></h3>
<p>PyO3 uses a build script (backed by the <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/tree/main/pyo3-build-config"><code>pyo3-build-config</code></a> crate) to determine the Python version and set the correct linker arguments. </p>
<ol>
<li>Order
By default it will attempt to use the following in order:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Any active <strong>Python virtualenv</strong>.</li>
<li>The <code>python</code> executable (if it’s a Python 3 interpreter).</li>
<li>The <code>python3</code> executable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Override
You can override the Python interpreter by setting the <code>PYO3_PYTHON</code> environment variable, e.g. <code>PYO3_PYTHON=python3.7</code>, <code>PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.9</code>, or even a PyPy interpreter <code>PYO3_PYTHON=pypy3</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build
Once the Python interpreter is located, <code>pyo3-build-config</code> executes it to query the information in the <code>sysconfig</code> module, which is needed to configure the rest of the compilation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To validate the configuration which PyO3 will use, you can run a compilation with the environment variable <code>PYO3_PRINT_CONFIG=1</code> set. </p>

<p>Python extension modules need to be compiled differently depending on the OS (and architecture) that they are being compiled for. 
As well as multiple OSes (and architectures), there are also many different Python versions which are actively supported. 
Packages uploaded to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> usually want to upload prebuilt “wheels” covering many OS/arch/version combinations so that users on all these different platforms don’t have to compile the package themselves. 
Package vendors can opt-in to the “abi3” limited Python API which allows their wheels to be used on multiple Python versions, reducing the number of wheels they need to compile, but restricts the functionality they can use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to go about this: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>it is possible to use <code>cargo</code> to build the extension module (along with some manual work, which varies with OS). </li>
<li>The PyO3 ecosystem has <strong>two packaging tools</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin"><code>maturin</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust"><code>setuptools-rust</code></a>, which abstract over the OS difference and also support building wheels for PyPI upload.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>PyO3 has some Cargo features to configure projects for building Python extension modules:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>extension-module</code> feature, which must be enabled when building Python extension modules.</li>
<li>The <code>abi3</code> feature and its version-specific <code>abi3-pyXY</code> companions, which are used to opt-in to the limited Python API in order to support multiple Python versions in a single wheel.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section describes each of these packaging tools before describing how to build manually without them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It then proceeds with an explanation of the <code>extension-module</code> feature. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, there is a section describing PyO3’s <code>abi3</code> features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="packaging-tools"><a class="header" href="#packaging-tools">Packaging tools</a></h3>
<p>The PyO3 ecosystem has two main choices to abstract the process of developing Python extension modules:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin"><code>maturin</code></a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>maturin is a command-line tool to build, package and upload Python modules.</li>
<li>It makes opinionated choices about project layout meaning it needs very little configuration.</li>
<li>This makes it a great choice for users who are building a Python extension from scratch and don’t need flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust"><code>setuptools-rust</code></a> </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>setuptools-rust is an add-on for <code>setuptools</code> which adds extra keyword arguments to the <code>setup.py</code> configuration file. </li>
<li>It requires more configuration than <code>maturin</code>, however this gives additional flexibility for users adding Rust to an existing Python package that can’t satisfy <code>maturin</code>’s constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consult each project’s documentation for full details on how to get started using them and how to upload wheels to PyPI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/tree/main/examples/maturin-starter"><code>maturin-starter</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/tree/main/examples/setuptools-rust-starter"><code>setuptools-rust-starter</code></a> examples in the PyO3 repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="manual-builds"><a class="header" href="#manual-builds">Manual builds</a></h3>
<p>To build a PyO3-based Python extension manually, start by running <code>cargo build</code> as normal in a library project which uses PyO3’s <code>extension-module</code> feature and has the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#the-crate-type-field"><code>cdylib</code> crate type</a>.</p>
<p>Once built, symlink (or copy) and rename the shared library from Cargo’s <code>target/</code> directory to your desired output directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>on macOS, rename <code>libyour_module.dylib</code> to <code>your_module.so</code>.</li>
<li>on Windows, rename  <code>libyour_module.dll</code> to <code>your_module.pyd</code>.</li>
<li>on Linux, rename <code>libyour_module.so</code> to <code>your_module.so</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then open a Python shell in the output directory and you’ll be able to run <code>import your_module</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re packaging your library for redistribution, you should indicated the Python interpreter your library is compiled for by including the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#platform-tags">platform tag</a> in its name. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This prevents incompatible interpreters from trying to import your library. 
If you’re compiling for PyPy you <em>must</em> include the platform tag, or PyPy will ignore the module.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See, as an example, Bazel rules to build PyO3 on Linux at https://github.com/TheButlah/rules_pyo3.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="platform-tags"><a class="header" href="#platform-tags">Platform tags</a></h4>
<p>Rather than using just the <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code> extension suggested above (depending on OS), uou can prefix the shared library extension with a platform tag to indicate the interpreter it is compatible with. You can query your interpreter’s platform tag from the <code>sysconfig</code> module. Some example outputs of this are seen below:</p>

<p>So, for example, a valid module library name on CPython 3.10 for macOS is <code>your_module.cpython-310-darwin.so</code>, and its equivalent when compiled for PyPy 7.3 on Linux would be <code>your_module.pypy38-pp73-x86_64-linux-gnu.so</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3149/">PEP 3149</a> for more background on platform tags.</p>
<h4 id="macos"><a class="header" href="#macos">macOS</a></h4>
<p>On macOS, because the <code>extension-module</code> feature disables linking to <code>libpython</code> (<a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#the-extension-module-feature">see the next section</a>), some additional linker arguments need to be set. <code>maturin</code> and <code>setuptools-rust</code> both pass these arguments for PyO3 automatically, but projects using manual builds will need to set these directly in order to support macOS.</p>
<p>The easiest way to set the correct linker arguments is to add a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html"><code>build.rs</code></a> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
  pyo3_build_config::add_extension_module_link_args();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to also add <code>pyo3-build-config</code> to the <code>build-dependencies</code> section in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<p>An alternative to using <code>pyo3-build-config</code> is add the following to a cargo configuration file (e.g. <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=-undefined&quot;,
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=dynamic_lookup&quot;,
]

[target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=-undefined&quot;,
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=dynamic_lookup&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Using the MacOS system python3 (<code>/usr/bin/python3</code>, as opposed to python installed via homebrew, pyenv, nix, etc.) may result in runtime errors such as <code>Library not loaded: @rpath/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Python3</code>. These can be resolved with another addition to <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build]
rustflags = [
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-args=-Wl,-rpath,/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, on rust &gt;= 1.56, one can include in <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(
        &quot;cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks&quot;
    );
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>For more discussion on and workarounds for MacOS linking problems <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1800#issuecomment-906786649">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget that on MacOS the <code>extension-module</code> feature will cause <code>cargo test</code> to fail without the <code>--no-default-features</code> flag (see <a href="https://pyo3.rs/main/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror">the FAQ</a>).</p>
<h3 id="the-extension-module-feature"><a class="header" href="#the-extension-module-feature">The <code>extension-module</code> feature</a></h3>
<p>PyO3’s <code>extension-module</code> feature is used to disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linking</a> to <code>libpython</code> on unix targets.</p>
<p>This is necessary because by default PyO3 links to <code>libpython</code>. This makes binaries, tests, and examples “just work”. However, Python extensions on unix must not link to libpython for <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux</a> compliance.</p>
<p>The downside of not linking to <code>libpython</code> is that binaries, tests, and examples (which usually embed Python) will fail to build. If you have an extension module as well as other outputs in a single project, you need to use optional Cargo features to disable the <code>extension-module</code> when you’re not building the extension module. See <a href="PyO3_guides/src/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-or-i-cant-build-in-a-cargo-workspace-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror">the FAQ</a> for an example workaround.</p>
<h3 id="py_limited_apiabi3"><a class="header" href="#py_limited_apiabi3"><code>Py_LIMITED_API</code>/<code>abi3</code></a></h3>
<p>By default, Python extension modules can only be used with the same Python version they were compiled against. For example, an extension module built for Python 3.5 can’t be imported in Python 3.8. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/">PEP 384</a> introduced the idea of the limited Python API, which would have a stable ABI enabling extension modules built with it to be used against multiple Python versions. This is also known as <code>abi3</code>.</p>
<p>The advantage of building extension modules using the limited Python API is that package vendors only need to build and distribute a single copy (for each OS / architecture), and users can install it on all Python versions from the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#minimum-python-version-for-abi3">minimum version</a> and up. The downside of this is that PyO3 can’t use optimizations which rely on being compiled against a known exact Python version. It’s up to you to decide whether this matters for your extension module. It’s also possible to design your extension module such that you can distribute <code>abi3</code> wheels but allow users compiling from source to benefit from additional optimizations - see the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/./building_and_distribution/multiple_python_versions.html">support for multiple python versions</a> section of this guide, in particular the <code>#[cfg(Py_LIMITED_API)]</code> flag.</p>
<p>There are three steps involved in making use of <code>abi3</code> when building Python packages as wheels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the <code>abi3</code> feature in <code>pyo3</code>. This ensures <code>pyo3</code> only calls Python C-API functions which are part of the stable API, and on Windows also ensures that the project links against the correct shared object (no special behavior is required on other platforms):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
pyo3 = { {{#PYO3_CRATE_VERSION}}, features = [&quot;abi3&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Ensure that the built shared objects are correctly marked as <code>abi3</code>. This is accomplished by telling your build system that you’re using the limited API. <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin"><code>maturin</code></a> &gt;= 0.9.0 and <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust"><code>setuptools-rust</code></a> &gt;= 0.11.4 support <code>abi3</code> wheels.
See the <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/pull/353">corresponding</a> <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust/pull/82">PRs</a> for more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the <code>.whl</code> is correctly marked as <code>abi3</code>. For projects using <code>setuptools</code>, this is accomplished by passing <code>--py-limited-api=cp3x</code> (where <code>x</code> is the minimum Python version supported by the wheel, e.g. <code>--py-limited-api=cp35</code> for Python 3.5) to <code>setup.py bdist_wheel</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="minimum-python-version-for-abi3"><a class="header" href="#minimum-python-version-for-abi3">Minimum Python version for <code>abi3</code></a></h4>
<p>Because a single <code>abi3</code> wheel can be used with many different Python versions, PyO3 has feature flags <code>abi3-py37</code>, <code>abi3-py38</code>, <code>abi3-py39</code> etc. to set the minimum required Python version for your <code>abi3</code> wheel.
For example, if you set the <code>abi3-py37</code> feature, your extension wheel can be used on all Python 3 versions from Python 3.7 and up. <code>maturin</code> and <code>setuptools-rust</code> will give the wheel a name like <code>my-extension-1.0-cp37-abi3-manylinux2020_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>As your extension module may be run with multiple different Python versions you may occasionally find you need to check the Python version at runtime to customize behavior. See <a href="PyO3_guides/src/./building_and_distribution/multiple_python_versions.html#checking-the-python-version-at-runtime">the relevant section of this guide</a> on supporting multiple Python versions at runtime.</p>
<p>PyO3 is only able to link your extension module to api3 version up to and including your host Python version. E.g., if you set <code>abi3-py38</code> and try to compile the crate with a host of Python 3.7, the build will fail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you set more that one of these api version feature flags the lowest version always wins. For example, with both <code>abi3-py37</code> and <code>abi3-py38</code> set, PyO3 would build a wheel which supports Python 3.7 and up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="building-abi3-extensions-without-a-python-interpreter"><a class="header" href="#building-abi3-extensions-without-a-python-interpreter">Building <code>abi3</code> extensions without a Python interpreter</a></h4>
<p>As an advanced feature, you can build PyO3 wheel without calling Python interpreter with the environment variable <code>PYO3_NO_PYTHON</code> set.
Also, if the build host Python interpreter is not found or is too old or otherwise unusable,
PyO3 will still attempt to compile <code>abi3</code> extension modules after displaying a warning message.
On Unix-like systems this works unconditionally; on Windows you must also set the <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> environment variable
to contain <code>-L native=/path/to/python/libs</code> so that the linker can find <code>python3.lib</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>python3.dll</code> import library is not available, an experimental <code>generate-import-lib</code> crate
feature may be enabled, and the required library will be created and used by PyO3 automatically.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: MSVC targets require LLVM binutils (<code>llvm-dlltool</code>) to be available in <code>PATH</code> for
the automatic import library generation feature to work.</p>
<h4 id="missing-features"><a class="header" href="#missing-features">Missing features</a></h4>
<p>Due to limitations in the Python API, there are a few <code>pyo3</code> features that do
not work when compiling for <code>abi3</code>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[pyo3(text_signature = &quot;...&quot;)]</code> does not work on classes until Python 3.10 or greater.</li>
<li>The <code>dict</code> and <code>weakref</code> options on classes are not supported until Python 3.9 or greater.</li>
<li>The buffer API is not supported until Python 3.11 or greater.</li>
<li>Optimizations which rely on knowledge of the exact Python version compiled against.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embedding-python-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#embedding-python-in-rust">Embedding Python in Rust</a></h2>
<p>If you want to embed the Python interpreter inside a Rust program, there are two modes in which this can be done: dynamically and statically. We’ll cover each of these modes in the following sections. Each of them affect how you must distribute your program. Instead of learning how to do this yourself, you might want to consider using a project like <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a> to ship your application and all of its dependencies in a single file.</p>
<p>PyO3 automatically switches between the two linking modes depending on whether the Python distribution you have configured PyO3 to use (<a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#python-version">see above</a>) contains a shared library or a static library. The static library is most often seen in Python distributions compiled from source without the <code>--enable-shared</code> configuration option. For example, this is the default for <code>pyenv</code> on macOS.</p>
<h3 id="dynamically-embedding-the-python-interpreter"><a class="header" href="#dynamically-embedding-the-python-interpreter">Dynamically embedding the Python interpreter</a></h3>
<p>Embedding the Python interpreter dynamically is much easier than doing so statically. This is done by linking your program against a Python shared library (such as <code>libpython.3.9.so</code> on UNIX, or <code>python39.dll</code> on Windows). The implementation of the Python interpreter resides inside the shared library. This means that when the OS runs your Rust program it also needs to be able to find the Python shared library.</p>
<p>This mode of embedding works well for Rust tests which need access to the Python interpreter. It is also great for Rust software which is installed inside a Python virtualenv, because the virtualenv sets up appropriate environment variables to locate the correct Python shared library.</p>
<p>For distributing your program to non-technical users, you will have to consider including the Python shared library in your distribution as well as setting up wrapper scripts to set the right environment variables (such as <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on UNIX, or <code>PATH</code> on Windows).</p>
<p>Note that PyPy cannot be embedded in Rust (or any other software). Support for this is tracked on the <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3286">PyPy issue tracker</a>.</p>
<h3 id="statically-embedding-the-python-interpreter"><a class="header" href="#statically-embedding-the-python-interpreter">Statically embedding the Python interpreter</a></h3>
<p>Embedding the Python interpreter statically means including the contents of a Python static library directly inside your Rust binary. This means that to distribute your program you only need to ship your binary file: it contains the Python interpreter inside the binary!</p>
<p>On Windows static linking is almost never done, so Python distributions don’t usually include a static library. The information below applies only to UNIX.</p>
<p>The Python static library is usually called <code>libpython.a</code>.</p>
<p>Static linking has a lot of complications, listed below. For these reasons PyO3 does not yet have first-class support for this embedding mode. See <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/416">issue 416 on PyO3’s Github</a> for more information and to discuss any issues you encounter.</p>
<p>The <a href="PyO3_guides/src/features.html#auto-initialize"><code>auto-initialize</code></a> feature is deliberately disabled when embedding the interpreter statically because this is often unintentionally done by new users to PyO3 running test programs. Trying out PyO3 is much easier using dynamic embedding.</p>
<p>The known complications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To import compiled extension modules (such as other Rust extension modules, or those written in C), your binary must have the correct linker flags set during compilation to export the original contents of <code>libpython.a</code> so that extensions can use them (e.g. <code>-Wl,--export-dynamic</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C compiler and flags which were used to create <code>libpython.a</code> must be compatible with your Rust compiler and flags, else you will experience compilation failures.</p>
<p>Significantly different compiler versions may see errors like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">lto1: fatal error: bytecode stream in file 'rust-numpy/target/release/deps/libpyo3-6a7fb2ed970dbf26.rlib' generated with LTO version 6.0 instead of the expected 6.2
</code></pre>
<p>Mismatching flags may lead to errors like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.9.a(zlibmodule.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.data' can not be used when making a PIE object; recompile with -fPIE
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter these or other complications when linking the interpreter statically, discuss them on <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/416">issue 416 on PyO3’s Github</a>. It is hoped that eventually that discussion will contain enough information and solutions that PyO3 can offer first-class support for static embedding.</p>
<h3 id="import-your-module-when-embedding-the-python-interpreter"><a class="header" href="#import-your-module-when-embedding-the-python-interpreter">Import your module when embedding the Python interpreter</a></h3>
<p>When you run your Rust binary with an embedded interpreter, any <code>#[pymodule]</code> created modules won’t be accessible to import unless added to a table called <code>PyImport_Inittab</code> before the embedded interpreter is initialized. This will cause Python statements in your embedded interpreter such as <code>import your_new_module</code> to fail. You can call the macro <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/macro.append_to_inittab.html"><code>append_to_inittab</code></a> with your module before initializing the Python interpreter to add the module function into that table. (The Python interpreter will be initialized by calling <code>prepare_freethreaded_python</code>, <code>with_embedded_interpreter</code>, or <code>Python::with_gil</code> with the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/features.html#auto-initialize"><code>auto-initialize</code></a> feature enabled.)</p>
<h2 id="cross-compiling"><a class="header" href="#cross-compiling">Cross Compiling</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to Rust’s great cross-compilation support, cross-compiling using PyO3 is relatively straightforward. To get started, you’ll need a few pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>A toolchain for your target.</li>
<li>The appropriate options in your Cargo <code>.config</code> for the platform you’re targeting and the toolchain you are using.</li>
<li>A Python interpreter that’s already been compiled for your target (optional when building “abi3” extension modules).</li>
<li>A Python interpreter that is built for your host and available through the <code>PATH</code> or setting the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution.html#python-version"><code>PYO3_PYTHON</code></a> variable (optional when building “abi3” extension modules).</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve obtained the above, you can build a cross-compiled PyO3 module by using Cargo’s <code>--target</code> flag. PyO3’s build script will detect that you are attempting a cross-compile based on your host machine and the desired target.</p>
<p>When cross-compiling, PyO3’s build script cannot execute the target Python interpreter to query the configuration, so there are a few additional environment variables you may need to set:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PYO3_CROSS</code>: If present this variable forces PyO3 to configure as a cross-compilation.</li>
<li><code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code>: This variable can be set to the directory containing the target’s libpython DSO and the associated <code>_sysconfigdata*.py</code> file for Unix-like targets, or the Python DLL import libraries for the Windows target. This variable is only needed when the output binary must link to libpython explicitly (e.g. when targeting Windows and Android or embedding a Python interpreter), or when it is absolutely required to get the interpreter configuration from <code>_sysconfigdata*.py</code>.</li>
<li><code>PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_VERSION</code>: Major and minor version (e.g. 3.9) of the target Python installation. This variable is only needed if PyO3 cannot determine the version to target from <code>abi3-py3*</code> features, or if <code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code> is not set, or if there are multiple versions of Python present in <code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code>.</li>
<li><code>PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION</code>: Python implementation name (“CPython” or “PyPy”) of the target Python installation. CPython is assumed by default when this variable is not set, unless <code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code> is set for a Unix-like target and PyO3 can get the interpreter configuration from <code>_sysconfigdata*.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An experimental <code>pyo3</code> crate feature <code>generate-import-lib</code> enables the user to cross-compile
extension modules for Windows targets without setting the <code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code> environment
variable or providing any Windows Python library files. It uses an external <a href="https://docs.rs/python3-dll-a/latest/python3_dll_a/"><code>python3-dll-a</code></a> crate
to generate import libraries for the Python DLL for MinGW-w64 and MSVC compile targets.
<code>python3-dll-a</code> uses the binutils <code>dlltool</code> program to generate DLL import libraries for MinGW-w64 targets.
It is possible to override the default <code>dlltool</code> command name for the cross target
by setting <code>PYO3_MINGW_DLLTOOL</code> environment variable.
<em>Note</em>: MSVC targets require LLVM binutils or MSVC build tools to be available on the host system.
More specifically, <code>python3-dll-a</code> requires <code>llvm-dlltool</code> or <code>lib.exe</code> executable to be present in <code>PATH</code> when
targeting <code>*-pc-windows-msvc</code>. Zig compiler executable can be used in place of <code>llvm-dlltool</code> when <code>ZIG_COMMAND</code>
environment variable is set to the installed Zig program name (<code>&quot;zig&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;python -m ziglang&quot;</code>).</p>
<p>An example might look like the following (assuming your target’s sysroot is at <code>/home/pyo3/cross/sysroot</code> and that your target is <code>armv7</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR=&quot;/home/pyo3/cross/sysroot/usr/lib&quot;

cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
</code></pre>
<p>If there are multiple python versions at the cross lib directory and you cannot set a more precise location to include both the <code>libpython</code> DSO and <code>_sysconfigdata*.py</code> files, you can set the required version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8
export PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR=&quot;/home/pyo3/cross/sysroot/usr/lib&quot;

cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
</code></pre>
<p>Or another example with the same sys root but building for Windows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.9
export PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR=&quot;/home/pyo3/cross/sysroot/usr/lib&quot;

cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Any of the <code>abi3-py3*</code> features can be enabled instead of setting <code>PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_VERSION</code> in the above examples.</p>
<p><code>PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR</code> can often be omitted when cross compiling extension modules for Unix and macOS targets,
or when cross compiling extension modules for Windows and the experimental <code>generate-import-lib</code>
crate feature is enabled.</p>
<p>The following resources may also be useful for cross-compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross">github.com/japaric/rust-cross</a> is a primer on cross compiling Rust.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">github.com/rust-embedded/cross</a> uses Docker to make Rust cross-compilation easier.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="supporting-multiple-python-versions"><a class="header" href="#supporting-multiple-python-versions">Supporting multiple Python versions</a></h1>
<p>PyO3 supports all actively-supported Python 3 and PyPy versions. As much as possible, this is done internally to PyO3 so that your crate’s code does not need to adapt to the differences between each version. However, as Python features grow and change between versions, PyO3 cannot a completely identical API for every Python version. This may require you to add conditional compilation to your crate or runtime checks for the Python version.</p>
<p>This section of the guide first introduces the <code>pyo3-build-config</code> crate, which you can use as a <code>build-dependency</code> to add additional <code>#[cfg]</code> flags which allow you to support multiple Python versions at compile-time.</p>
<p>Second, we’ll show how to check the Python version at runtime. This can be useful when building for multiple versions with the <code>abi3</code> feature, where the Python API compiled against is not always the same as the one in use.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation-for-different-python-versions"><a class="header" href="#conditional-compilation-for-different-python-versions">Conditional compilation for different Python versions</a></h2>
<p>The <code>pyo3-build-config</code> exposes multiple <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/attribute/cfg.html"><code>#[cfg]</code> flags</a> which can be used to conditionally compile code for a given Python version. PyO3 itself depends on this crate, so by using it you can be sure that you are configured correctly for the Python version PyO3 is building against.</p>
<p>This allows us to write code like the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[cfg(Py_3_7)]
fn function_only_supported_on_python_3_7_and_up() { }

#[cfg(not(Py_3_8))]
fn function_only_supported_before_python_3_8() { }

#[cfg(not(Py_LIMITED_API))]
fn function_incompatible_with_abi3_feature() { }
</code></pre>
<p>The following sections first show how to add these <code>#[cfg]</code> flags to your build process, and then cover some common patterns flags in a little more detail.</p>
<p>To see a full reference of all the <code>#[cfg]</code> flags provided, see the <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-build-config"><code>pyo3-build-cfg</code> docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-pyo3-build-config"><a class="header" href="#using-pyo3-build-config">Using <code>pyo3-build-config</code></a></h3>
<p>You can use the <code>#[cfg]</code> flags in just two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add <code>pyo3-build-config</code> with the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution/../features.html#resolve-config"><code>resolve-config</code></a> feature enabled to your crate’s build dependencies in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-dependencies]
pyo3-build-config = { {{#PYO3_CRATE_VERSION}}, features = [&quot;resolve-config&quot;] }

</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html"><code>build.rs</code></a> file to your crate with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    // If you have an existing build.rs file, just add this line to it.
    pyo3_build_config::use_pyo3_cfgs();
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After these steps you are ready to annotate your code!</p>
<h3 id="common-usages-of-pyo3-build-cfg-flags"><a class="header" href="#common-usages-of-pyo3-build-cfg-flags">Common usages of <code>pyo3-build-cfg</code> flags</a></h3>
<p>The <code>#[cfg]</code> flags added by <code>pyo3-build-cfg</code> can be combined with all of Rust’s logic in the <code>#[cfg]</code> attribute to create very precise conditional code generation. The following are some common patterns implemented using these flags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">#[cfg(Py_3_7)]
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>#[cfg]</code> marks code that will only be present on Python 3.7 and upwards. There are similar options <code>Py_3_8</code>, <code>Py_3_9</code>, <code>Py_3_10</code> and so on for each minor version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">#[cfg(not(Py_3_7))]
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>#[cfg]</code> marks code that will only be present on Python versions before (but not including) Python 3.7.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">#[cfg(not(Py_LIMITED_API))]
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>#[cfg]</code> marks code that is only available when building for the unlimited Python API (i.e. PyO3’s <code>abi3</code> feature is not enabled). This might be useful if you want to ship your extension module as an <code>abi3</code> wheel and also allow users to compile it from source to make use of optimizations only possible with the unlimited API.</p>

<p>When building with PyO3’s <code>abi3</code> feature, your extension module will be compiled against a specific <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution/../building_and_distribution.html#minimum-python-version-for-abi3">minimum version</a> of Python, but may be running on newer Python versions.</p>
<p>For example with PyO3’s <code>abi3-py38</code> feature, your extension will be compiled as if it were for Python 3.8. If you were using <code>pyo3-build-config</code>, <code>#[cfg(Py_3_8)]</code> would be present. Your user could freely install and run your abi3 extension on Python 3.9.</p>
<p>There’s no way to detect your user doing that at compile time, so instead you need to fall back to runtime checks.</p>
<p>PyO3 provides the APIs <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.version"><code>Python::version()</code></a> and <a href="PyO3_guides/src/building_and_distribution/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Python.html#method.version_info"><code>Python::version_info()</code></a> to query the running Python version.

<p>It is desirable if both the Python and Rust parts of the application end up
logging using the same configuration into the same place.</p>
<p>This section of the guide briefly discusses how to connect the two languages’
logging ecosystems together. The recommended way for Python extension modules is
to configure Rust’s logger to send log messages to Python using the <code>pyo3-log</code>
crate. For users who want to do the opposite and send Python log messages to
Rust, see the note at the end of this guide.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pyo3-log">pyo3-log</a> crate allows sending the messages from the Rust side to Python’s
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html">logging</a> system. This is mostly suitable for writing native extensions for
Python programs.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-log/*/pyo3_log/fn.init.html"><code>pyo3_log::init</code></a> to install the logger in its default configuration.
It’s also possible to tweak its configuration (mostly to tune its performance).</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use log::info;

<p>Then it is up to the Python side to actually output the messages somewhere.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import logging

FORMAT = '%(levelname)s %(name)s %(asctime)-15s %(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s'
logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)
my_module.log_something()

<p>It is important to initialize the Python loggers first, before calling any Rust
functions that may log. This limitation can be worked around if it is not
possible to satisfy, read the documentation about <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-log/*/pyo3_log/#performance-filtering-and-caching">caching</a>.</p>

<p>If you are working with a Python library that makes use of async functions or wish to provide
Python bindings for an async Rust library, <a href="https://github.com/awestlake87/pyo3-asyncio"><code>pyo3-asyncio</code></a>
likely has the tools you need. It provides conversions between async functions in both Python and
Rust and was designed with first-class support for popular Rust runtimes such as
<a href="https://tokio.rs/"><code>tokio</code></a> and <a href="https://async.rs/"><code>async-std</code></a>. In addition, all async Python
code runs on the default <code>asyncio</code> event loop, so <code>pyo3-asyncio</code> should work just fine with existing
Python libraries.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll give a general overview of <code>pyo3-asyncio</code> explaining how to call
async Python functions with PyO3, how to call async Rust functions from Python, and how to configure
your codebase to manage the runtimes of both.</p>

<h2 id="awaiting-an-async-python-function-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#awaiting-an-async-python-function-in-rust">Awaiting an Async Python Function in Rust</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at a dead simple async Python function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Sleep for 1 second
async def py_sleep():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Async functions in Python are simply functions that return a <code>coroutine</code> object</strong>. For our purposes,
we really don’t need to know much about these <code>coroutine</code> objects. The key factor here is that calling
an <code>async</code> function is <em>just like calling a regular function</em>, the only difference is that we have
to do something special with the object that it returns.</p>
<p>Normally in Python, that something special is the <code>await</code> keyword, but in order to await this
coroutine in Rust, we first need to convert it into Rust’s version of a <code>coroutine</code>: a <code>Future</code>.
That’s where <code>pyo3-asyncio</code> comes in.
<a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/latest/pyo3_asyncio/fn.into_future.html"><code>pyo3_asyncio::into_future</code></a>
performs this conversion for us.</p>
<p>The following example uses <code>into_future</code> to call the <code>py_sleep</code> function shown above and then await the
coroutine object returned from the call:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyo3_asyncio::tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    let future = Python::with_gil(|py| -&gt; PyResult&lt;_&gt; {
        // import the module containing the py_sleep function
        let example = py.import(&quot;example&quot;)?;

        // calling the py_sleep method like a normal function
        // returns a coroutine
        let coroutine = example.call_method0(&quot;py_sleep&quot;)?;

        // convert the coroutine into a Rust future using the
        // tokio runtime
        pyo3_asyncio::tokio::into_future(coroutine)
    })?;

    // await the future
    future.await?;

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the below example shows how to write a <code>#[pyfunction]</code> which uses <code>into_future</code> to receive and await
a coroutine argument:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[pyfunction]
fn await_coro(coro: &amp;PyAny) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    // convert the coroutine into a Rust future using the
    // async_std runtime
    let f = pyo3_asyncio::async_std::into_future(coro)?;

    pyo3_asyncio::async_std::run_until_complete(coro.py(), async move {
        // await the future
        f.await?;
        Ok(())
    })
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This could be called from Python as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import asyncio

async def py_sleep():
    asyncio.sleep(1)

await_coro(py_sleep())
</code></pre>
<p>If for you wanted to pass a callable function to the <code>#[pyfunction]</code> instead, (i.e. the last line becomes <code>await_coro(py_sleep))</code>, then the above example needs to be tweaked to first call the callable to get the coroutine:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[pyfunction]
fn await_coro(callable: &amp;PyAny) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    // get the coroutine by calling the callable
    let coro = callable.call0()?;

    // convert the coroutine into a Rust future using the
    // async_std runtime
    let f = pyo3_asyncio::async_std::into_future(coro)?;

    pyo3_asyncio::async_std::run_until_complete(coro.py(), async move {
        // await the future
        f.await?;
        Ok(())
    })
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This can be particularly helpful where you need to repeatedly create and await a coroutine. Trying to await the same coroutine multiple times will raise an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">RuntimeError: cannot reuse already awaited coroutine
</code></pre>

</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let future = rust_sleep();
<span class="boring">}

<p>We can convert this <code>Future</code> object into Python to make it <code>awaitable</code>. This tells Python that you
can use the <code>await</code> keyword with it. In order to do this, we’ll call
<a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/latest/pyo3_asyncio/async_std/fn.future_into_py.html"><code>pyo3_asyncio::async_std::future_into_py</code></a>:</p>

        Ok(Python::with_gil(|py| py.None()))
    })
}
<span class="boring">}

<p>In Python, we can call this pyo3 function just like any other async function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from example import call_rust_sleep

async def rust_sleep():
    await call_rust_sleep()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="managing-event-loops"><a class="header" href="#managing-event-loops">Managing Event Loops</a></h2>
<p>Python’s event loop requires some special treatment, especially regarding the main thread. Some of
Python’s <code>asyncio</code> features, like proper signal handling, require control over the main thread, which
doesn’t always play well with Rust.</p>
<p>Luckily, Rust’s event loops are pretty flexible and don’t <em>need</em> control over the main thread, so in
<code>pyo3-asyncio</code>, we decided the best way to handle Rust/Python interop was to just surrender the main
thread to Python and run Rust’s event loops in the background. Unfortunately, since most event loop
implementations <em>prefer</em> control over the main thread, this can still make some things awkward.</p>
<h3 id="pyo3-asyncio-initialization"><a class="header" href="#pyo3-asyncio-initialization">PyO3 Asyncio Initialization</a></h3>
<p>Because Python needs to control the main thread, we can’t use the convenient proc macros from Rust
runtimes to handle the <code>main</code> function or <code>#[test]</code> functions. Instead, the initialization for PyO3 has to be done from the <code>main</code> function and the main
thread must block on <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/latest/pyo3_asyncio/fn.run_forever.html"><code>pyo3_asyncio::run_forever</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/latest/pyo3_asyncio/async_std/fn.run_until_complete.html"><code>pyo3_asyncio::async_std::run_until_complete</code></a>.</p>
<p>Because we have to block on one of those functions, we can’t use <a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/attr.main.html"><code>#[async_std::main]</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.1.0/tokio/attr.main.html"><code>#[tokio::main]</code></a>
since it’s not a good idea to make long blocking calls during an async function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internally, these <code>#[main]</code> proc macros are expanded to something like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // your async main fn
    async fn _main_impl() { /* ... */ }
    Runtime::new().block_on(_main_impl());
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Making a long blocking call inside the <code>Future</code> that’s being driven by <code>block_on</code> prevents that
thread from doing anything else and can spell trouble for some runtimes (also this will actually
deadlock a single-threaded runtime!). Many runtimes have some sort of <code>spawn_blocking</code> mechanism
that can avoid this problem, but again that’s not something we can use here since we need it to
block on the <em>main</em> thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this reason, <code>pyo3-asyncio</code> provides its own set of proc macros to provide you with this
initialization. These macros are intended to mirror the initialization of <code>async-std</code> and <code>tokio</code>
while also satisfying the Python runtime’s needs.</p>
<p>Here’s a full example of PyO3 initialization with the <code>async-std</code> runtime:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyo3_asyncio::async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    // PyO3 is initialized - Ready to go

    let fut = Python::with_gil(|py| -&gt; PyResult&lt;_&gt; {
        let asyncio = py.import(&quot;asyncio&quot;)?;

        // convert asyncio.sleep into a Rust Future
        pyo3_asyncio::async_std::into_future(
            asyncio.call_method1(&quot;sleep&quot;, (1.into_py(py),))?
        )
    })?;

    fut.await?;

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="a-note-about-asynciorun"><a class="header" href="#a-note-about-asynciorun">A Note About <code>asyncio.run</code></a></h3>
<p>In Python 3.7+, the recommended way to run a top-level coroutine with <code>asyncio</code>
is with <code>asyncio.run</code>. In <code>v0.13</code> we recommended against using this function due to initialization issues, but in <code>v0.14</code> it’s perfectly valid to use this function… with a caveat.</p>
<p>Since our Rust &lt;–&gt; Python conversions require a reference to the Python event loop, this poses a problem. Imagine we have a PyO3 Asyncio module that defines
a <code>rust_sleep</code> function like in previous examples. You might rightfully assume that you can call pass this directly into <code>asyncio.run</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import asyncio

from my_async_module import rust_sleep

asyncio.run(rust_sleep())
</code></pre>
<p>You might be surprised to find out that this throws an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;example.py&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    asyncio.run(rust_sleep())
RuntimeError: no running event loop
</code></pre>
<p>What’s happening here is that we are calling <code>rust_sleep</code> <em>before</em> the future is
actually running on the event loop created by <code>asyncio.run</code>. This is counter-intuitive, but expected behaviour, and unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a good way of solving this problem within PyO3 Asyncio itself.</p>
<p>However, we can make this example work with a simple workaround:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import asyncio

from my_async_module import rust_sleep

# Calling main will just construct the coroutine that later calls rust_sleep.
# - This ensures that rust_sleep will be called when the event loop is running,
#   not before.
async def main():
    await rust_sleep()

# Run the main() coroutine at the top-level instead
asyncio.run(main())

<li>Managing event loop references can be tricky with pyo3-asyncio. See <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/#event-loop-references">Event Loop References</a> in the API docs to get a better intuition for how event loop references are managed in this library.</li>
<li>Testing pyo3-asyncio libraries and applications requires a custom test harness since Python requires control over the main thread. You can find a testing guide in the <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3-asyncio/latest/pyo3_asyncio/testing">API docs for the <code>testing</code> module</a></li>

<p><code>lazy_static</code> and <code>once_cell::sync</code> both use locks to ensure that initialization is performed only by a single thread. Because the Python GIL is an additional lock this can lead to deadlocks in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>A thread (thread A) which has acquired the Python GIL starts initialization of a <code>lazy_static</code> value.</li>
<li>The initialization code calls some Python API which temporarily releases the GIL e.g. <code>Python::import</code>.</li>
<li>Another thread (thread B) acquires the Python GIL and attempts to access the same <code>lazy_static</code> value.</li>
<li>Thread B is blocked, because it waits for <code>lazy_static</code>’s initialization to lock to release.</li>
<li>Thread A is blocked, because it waits to re-acquire the GIL which thread B still holds.</li>
<li>Deadlock.</li>
</ol>
<p>PyO3 provides a struct <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/once_cell/struct.GILOnceCell.html"><code>GILOnceCell</code></a> which works equivalently to <code>OnceCell</code> but relies solely on the Python GIL for thread safety. This means it can be used in place of <code>lazy_static</code> or <code>once_cell</code> where you are experiencing the deadlock described above. See the documentation for <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/once_cell/struct.GILOnceCell.html"><code>GILOnceCell</code></a> for an example how to use it.</p>

<p>The Rust book suggests to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests">put integration tests inside a <code>tests/</code> directory</a>.</p>
<p>For a PyO3 <code>extension-module</code> project where the <code>crate-type</code> is set to <code>&quot;cdylib&quot;</code> in your <code>Cargo.toml</code>,
the compiler won’t be able to find your crate and will display errors such as <code>E0432</code> or <code>E0463</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0432]: unresolved import `my_crate`
 --&gt; tests/test_my_crate.rs:1:5
  |
1 | use my_crate;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ no external crate `my_crate`
</code></pre>
<p>The best solution is to make your crate types include both <code>rlib</code> and <code>cdylib</code>:</p>

[lib]
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;, &quot;rlib&quot;]

<p>This is because Ctrl-C raises a SIGINT signal, which is handled by the calling Python process by simply setting a flag to action upon later. This flag isn’t checked while Rust code called from Python is executing, only once control returns to the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>You can give the Python interpreter a chance to process the signal properly by calling <code>Python::check_signals</code>. It’s good practice to call this function regularly if you have a long-running Rust function so that your users can cancel it.</p>
<h2 id="pyo3get-clones-my-field"><a class="header" href="#pyo3get-clones-my-field"><code>#[pyo3(get)]</code> clones my field!</a></h2>
<p>You may have a nested struct similar to this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">use pyo3::prelude::*;
</span>#[pyclass]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Inner { /* fields omitted */ }

#[pyclass]
struct Outer {
    #[pyo3(get)]
    inner: Inner,
}

#[pymethods]
impl Outer {
    #[new]
    fn __new__() -&gt; Self {
        Self { inner: Inner {} }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When Python code accesses <code>Outer</code>’s field, PyO3 will return a new object on every access (note that their addresses are different):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">outer = Outer()

a = outer.inner
b = outer.inner

assert a is b, f&quot;a: {a}\nb: {b}&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">AssertionError: a: &lt;builtins.Inner object at 0x00000238FFB9C7B0&gt;
b: &lt;builtins.Inner object at 0x00000238FFB9C830&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This can be especially confusing if the field is mutable, as getting the field and then mutating it won’t persist - you’ll just get a fresh clone of the original on the next access. Unfortunately Python and Rust don’t agree about ownership - if PyO3 gave out references to (possibly) temporary Rust objects to Python code, Python code could then keep that reference alive indefinitely. Therefore returning Rust objects requires cloning.</p>
<p>If you don’t want that cloning to happen, a workaround is to allocate the field on the Python heap and store a reference to that, by using <a href="PyO3_guides/src/%7B%7B#PYO3_DOCS_URL%7D%7D/pyo3/struct.Py.html"><code>Py&lt;...&gt;</code></a>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

impl Outer {
    #[new]
    fn __new__(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; PyResult&lt;Self&gt; {
        Ok(Self {
            inner: Py::new(py, Inner {})?,
        })
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This time <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <em>are</em> the same object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">outer = Outer()

a = outer.inner
b = outer.inner

assert a is b, f&quot;a: {a}\nb: {b}&quot;
print(f&quot;a: {a}\nb: {b}&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">a: &lt;builtins.Inner object at 0x0000020044FCC670&gt;
b: &lt;builtins.Inner object at 0x0000020044FCC670&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The downside to this approach is that any Rust code working on the <code>Outer</code> struct now has to acquire the GIL to do anything with its field.</p>

<p>All PyO3 proc-macros (<code>#[pyclass]</code>, <code>#[pyfunction]</code>, <code>#[derive(FromPyObject)]</code>

<h3 id="type-checks-have-been-changed-for-pymapping-and-pysequence-types"><a class="header" href="#type-checks-have-been-changed-for-pymapping-and-pysequence-types">Type checks have been changed for <code>PyMapping</code> and <code>PySequence</code> types</a></h3>
<p>Previously the type checks for <code>PyMapping</code> and <code>PySequence</code> (implemented in <code>PyTryFrom</code>)
used the Python C-API functions <code>PyMapping_Check</code> and <code>PySequence_Check</code>.
Unfortunately these functions are not sufficient for distinguishing such types,
leading to inconsistent behavior (see
<a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/2072">pyo3/pyo3#2072</a>).</p>
<p>PyO3 0.17 changes these downcast checks to explicityly test if the type is a
subclass of the corresponding abstract base class <code>collections.abc.Mapping</code> or
<code>collections.abc.Sequence</code>. Note this requires calling into Python, which may
incur a performance penalty over the previous method. If this performance
penatly is a problem, you may be able to perform your own checks and use
<code>try_from_unchecked</code> (unsafe).</p>
<p>Another side-effect is that a pyclass defined in Rust with PyO3 will need to
be <em>registered</em> with the corresponding Python abstract base class for
downcasting to succeed. <code>PySequence::register</code> and <code>PyMapping:register</code> have
been added to make it easy to do this from Rust code. These are equivalent to
calling <code>collections.abc.Mapping.register(MappingPyClass)</code> or
<code>collections.abc.Sequence.register(SequencePyClass)</code> from Python.</p>
<p>For example, for a mapping class defined in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust compile_fail"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use pyo3::prelude::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[pyclass(mapping)]
struct Mapping {
    index: HashMap&lt;String, usize&gt;,
}

#[pymethods]
impl Mapping {
    #[new]
    fn new(elements: Option&lt;&amp;PyList&gt;) -&gt; PyResult&lt;Self&gt; {
    // ...
    // truncated implementation of this mapping pyclass - basically a wrapper around a HashMap
}

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You must register the class with <code>collections.abc.Mapping</code> before the downcast will work:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust compile_fail"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let m = Py::new(py, Mapping { index }).unwrap();
assert!(m.as_ref(py).downcast::&lt;PyMapping&gt;().is_err());
PyMapping::register::&lt;Mapping&gt;(py).unwrap();
assert!(m.as_ref(py).downcast::&lt;PyMapping&gt;().is_ok());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that this requirement may go away in the future when a pyclass is able to inherit from the abstract base class directly (see <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/991">pyo3/pyo3#991</a>).</p>
<p>### The <code>multiple-pymethods</code> feature now requires Rust 1.62</p>
<p>Due to limitations in the <code>inventory</code> crate which the <code>multiple-pymethods</code> feature depends on, this feature now

<p>PyO3 0.16 has increased minimum Rust version to 1.48 and minimum Python version to 3.7. This enables use of newer language features (enabling some of the other additions in 0.16) and simplifies maintenance of the project.</p>
<h3 id="pyproto-has-been-deprecated"><a class="header" href="#pyproto-has-been-deprecated"><code>#[pyproto]</code> has been deprecated</a></h3>
<p>In PyO3 0.15, the <code>#[pymethods]</code> attribute macro gained support for implementing “magic methods” such as <code>__str__</code> (aka “dunder” methods). This implementation was not quite finalized at the time, with a few edge cases to be decided upon. The existing <code>#[pyproto]</code> attribute macro was left untouched, because it covered these edge cases.</p>
<p>In PyO3 0.16, the <code>#[pymethods]</code> implementation has been completed and is now the preferred way to implement magic methods. To allow the PyO3 project to move forward, <code>#[pyproto]</code> has been deprecated (with expected removal in PyO3 0.18).</p>
<p>Migration from <code>#[pyproto]</code> to <code>#[pymethods]</code> is straightforward; copying the existing methods directly from the <code>#[pyproto]</code> trait implementation is all that is needed in most cases.</p>

<p>The Python object wrappers <code>Py</code> and <code>PyAny</code> had implementations of <code>PartialEq</code>
so that <code>object_a == object_b</code> would compare the Python objects for pointer
equality, which corresponds to the <code>is</code> operator, not the <code>==</code> operator in
Python.  This has been removed in favor of a new method: use
<code>object_a.is(object_b)</code>.  This also has the advantage of not requiring the same
wrapper type for <code>object_a</code> and <code>object_b</code>; you can now directly compare a
<code>Py&lt;T&gt;</code> with a <code>&amp;PyAny</code> without having to convert.</p>
<p>To check for Python object equality (the Python <code>==</code> operator), use the new
method <code>eq()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="container-magic-methods-now-match-python-behavior"><a class="header" href="#container-magic-methods-now-match-python-behavior">Container magic methods now match Python behavior</a></h3>
<p>In PyO3 0.15, <code>__getitem__</code>, <code>__setitem__</code> and <code>__delitem__</code> in <code>#[pymethods]</code> would generate only the <em>mapping</em> implementation for a <code>#[pyclass]</code>. To match the Python behavior, these methods now generate both the <em>mapping</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>sequence</em> implementations.</p>
<p>This means that classes implementing these <code>#[pymethods]</code> will now also be treated as sequences, same as a Python <code>class</code> would be. Small differences in behavior may result:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyO3 will allow instances of these classes to be cast to <code>PySequence</code> as well as <code>PyMapping</code>.</li>
<li>Python will provide a default implementation of <code>__iter__</code> (if the class did not have one) which repeatedly calls <code>__getitem__</code> with integers (starting at 0) until an <code>IndexError</code> is raised.</li>
</ul>
<p>To explain this in detail, consider the following Python class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class ExampleContainer:

    def __len__(self):
        return 5

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -&gt; int:
        if idx &lt; 0 or idx &gt; 5:
            raise IndexError()
        return idx
</code></pre>
<p>This class implements a Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence">sequence</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>__len__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code> methods are also used to implement a Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping">mapping</a>. In the Python C-API, these methods are not shared: the sequence <code>__len__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code> are defined by the <code>sq_length</code> and <code>sq_item</code> slots, and the mapping equivalents are <code>mp_length</code> and <code>mp_subscript</code>. There are similar distinctions for <code>__setitem__</code> and <code>__delitem__</code>.</p>
<p>Because there is no such distinction from Python, implementing these methods will fill the mapping and sequence slots simultaneously. A Python class with <code>__len__</code> implemented, for example, will have both the <code>sq_length</code> and <code>mp_length</code> slots filled.</p>
<p>The PyO3 behavior in 0.16 has been changed to be closer to this Python behavior by default.</p>

<p>Prior to PyO3 0.16 the <code>wrap_pymodule!</code> and <code>wrap_pyfunction!</code> macros could use modules and functions whose defining <code>fn</code> was not reachable according Rust privacy rules.</p>
<p>For example, the following code was legal before 0.16, but in 0.16 is rejected because the <code>wrap_pymodule!</code> macro cannot access the <code>private_submodule</code> function:</p>

<p>For all types that take sequence indices (<code>PyList</code>, <code>PyTuple</code> and <code>PySequence</code>),
the API has been made consistent to only take <code>usize</code> indices, for consistency
with Rust’s indexing conventions.  Negative indices, which were only
sporadically supported even in APIs that took <code>isize</code>, now aren’t supported
anywhere.</p>
<p>Further, the <code>get_item</code> methods now always return a <code>PyResult</code> instead of
panicking on invalid indices.  The <code>Index</code> trait has been implemented instead,
and provides the same panic behavior as on Rust vectors.</p>
<p>Note that <em>slice</em> indices (accepted by <code>PySequence::get_slice</code> and other) still
inherit the Python behavior of clamping the indices to the actual length, and
not panicking/returning an error on out of range indices.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of using Rust’s indexing conventions for these types is
that these types can now also support Rust’s indexing operators as part of a

<p>The largest of these is that all types created from PyO3 are what CPython calls “heap” types. The specific implications of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to subclass one of these types <em>from Rust</em> you must mark it <code>#[pyclass(subclass)]</code>, as you would if you wished to allow subclassing it from Python code.</li>
<li>Type objects are now mutable - Python code can set attributes on them.</li>

<p>In PyO3 <code>0.12</code> the <code>PyErr</code> type has been re-implemented to be significantly more compatible with
the standard Rust error handling ecosystem. Specifically <code>PyErr</code> now implements
<code>Error + Send + Sync</code>, which are the standard traits used for error types.</p>
<p>While this has necessitated the removal of a number of APIs, the resulting <code>PyErr</code> type should now
be much more easier to work with. The following sections list the changes in detail and how to
migrate to the new APIs.</p>

<p>For most uses no change will be needed. If you are trying to construct <code>PyErr</code> from a value that is
not <code>Send + Sync</code>, you will need to first create the Python object and then use
<code>PyErr::from_instance</code>.</p>

<p>It is no longer possible to access the fields <code>.ptype</code>, <code>.pvalue</code> and <code>.ptraceback</code> of a <code>PyErr</code>.

A common, safer way is using thread-safe types. E.g., <code>Arc</code> instead of <code>Rc</code>, <code>Mutex</code> instead of
<code>RefCell</code>, and <code>Box&lt;dyn Send + T&gt;</code> instead of <code>Box&lt;dyn T&gt;</code>.</p>

#[pyclass]

    shared_bools: Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;bool&gt;&gt;&gt;,

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In situations where you cannot change your <code>#[pyclass]</code> to automatically implement <code>Send</code>
(e.g., when it contains a raw pointer), you can use <code>unsafe impl Send</code>.
In such cases, care should be taken to ensure the struct is actually thread safe.
See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html">the Rustnomicon</a> for more.</p>

<li>
<p>If you think that your <code>#[pyclass]</code> should not be accessed by another thread, you can use
<code>unsendable</code> flag. A class marked with <code>unsendable</code> panics when accessed by another thread,
making it thread-safe to expose an unsendable object to the Python interpreter.</p>

<p>While in rust-cpython you always own python objects, PyO3 allows efficient <em>borrowed objects</em>
and most APIs are available with references.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the PyList API:</p>
<p><strong>rust-cpython</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl PyList {

   fn new(py: Python&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; PyList {...}

   fn get_item(&amp;self, py: Python&lt;'_&gt;, index: isize) -&gt; PyObject {...}

   fn get_item(&amp;self, index: isize) -&gt; &amp;PyAny {...}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In PyO3, all object references are bounded by the GIL lifetime.
So the owned Python object is not required, and it is safe to have functions like <code>fn py&lt;'p&gt;(&amp;'p self) -&gt; Python&lt;'p&gt; {}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling-4"><a class="header" href="#error-handling-4">Error handling</a></h2>
<p>rust-cpython requires a <code>Python</code> parameter for constructing a <code>PyErr</code>, so error handling ergonomics is pretty bad. It is not possible to use <code>?</code> with Rust errors.</p>
<p>PyO3 on other hand does not require <code>Python</code> for constructing a <code>PyErr</code>, it is only required if you want to raise an exception in Python with the <code>PyErr::restore()</code> method. Due to various <code>std::convert::From&lt;E&gt; for PyErr</code> implementations for Rust standard error types <code>E</code>, propagating <code>?</code> is supported automatically.</p>

<p>PyO3 allows for easy conversion from Rust to Python for certain functions and classes (see the <a href="PyO3_guides/src/conversions/tables.html">conversion table</a>.
However, it is not always straightforward to convert Rust code that requires a given trait implementation as an argument.</p>
<p>This tutorial explains how to convert a Rust function that takes a trait as argument for use in Python with classes implementing the same methods as the trait.</p>
<p>Why is this useful?</p>
<h3 id="pros"><a class="header" href="#pros">Pros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Make your Rust code available to Python users</li>
<li>Code complex algorithms in Rust with the help of the borrow checker</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons"><a class="header" href="#cons">Cons</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Not as fast as native Rust (type conversion has to be performed and one part of the code runs in Python)</li>
<li>You need to adapt your code to expose it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h2>
<p>Let’s work with the following basic example of an implementation of a optimization solver operating on a given model.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a function <code>solve</code> that operates on a model and mutates its state.
The argument of the function can be any model that implements the <code>Model</code> trait :</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">#![allow(dead_code)]
</span>pub trait Model {
  fn set_variables(&amp;mut self, inputs: &amp;Vec&lt;f64&gt;);
  fn compute(&amp;mut self);
  fn get_results(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;f64&gt;;
}

pub fn solve&lt;T: Model&gt;(model: &amp;mut T) {
  println!(&quot;Magic solver that mutates the model into a resolved state&quot;);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let’s assume we have the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot change that code as it runs on many Rust models.</li>
<li>We also have many Python models that cannot be solved as this solver is not available in that language.
Rewriting it in Python would be cumbersome and error-prone, as everything is already available in Rust.</li>
</ul>
<p>How could we expose this solver to Python thanks to PyO3 ?</p>
<h2 id="implementation-of-the-trait-bounds-for-the-python-class"><a class="header" href="#implementation-of-the-trait-bounds-for-the-python-class">Implementation of the trait bounds for the Python class</a></h2>
<p>If a Python class implements the same three methods as the <code>Model</code> trait, it seems logical it could be adapted to use the solver.
However, it is not possible to pass a <code>PyObject</code> to it as it does not implement the Rust trait (even if the Python model has the required methods).</p>
<p>In order to implement the trait, we must write a wrapper around the calls in Rust to the Python model.
The method signatures must be the same as the trait, keeping in mind that the Rust trait cannot be changed for the purpose of making the code available in Python.</p>
<p>The Python model we want to expose is the following one, which already contains all the required methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Model:
    def set_variables(self, inputs):
        self.inputs = inputs
    def compute(self):
        self.results = [elt**2 - 3 for elt in self.inputs]
    def get_results(self):
        return self.results
</code></pre>
<p>The following wrapper will call the Python model from Rust, using a struct to hold the model as a <code>PyAny</code> object:</p>

<p>Now that this bit is implemented, let’s expose the model wrapper to Python.
Let’s add the PyO3 annotations and add a constructor:</p>

<p>Now we add the PyO3 annotations to the trait implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[pymethods]
impl Model for UserModel {
  // the previous trait implementation
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, the previous code will not compile. The compilation error is the following one:
<code>error: #[pymethods] cannot be used on trait impl blocks</code></p>
<p>That’s a bummer!
However, we can write a second wrapper around these functions to call them directly.
This wrapper will also perform the type conversions between Python and Rust.</p>

<p>This wrapper handles the type conversion between the PyO3 requirements and the trait.
In order to meet PyO3 requirements, this wrapper must:</p>
<ul>
<li>return an object of type <code>PyResult</code></li>
<li>use only values, not references in the method signatures</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s run the file python file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Model:
    def set_variables(self, inputs):
        self.inputs = inputs
    def compute(self):
        self.results = [elt**2 - 3 for elt in self.inputs]
    def get_results(self):
        return self.results

if __name__==&quot;__main__&quot;:
  import trait_exposure

  myModel = Model()
  my_rust_model = trait_exposure.UserModel(myModel)
  my_rust_model.set_variables([2.0])
  print(&quot;Print value from Python: &quot;, myModel.inputs)
  my_rust_model.compute()
  print(&quot;Print value from Python through Rust: &quot;, my_rust_model.get_results())
  print(&quot;Print value directly from Python: &quot;, myModel.get_results())
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-block">Set variables from Python calling Rust

Print value from Python:  [2.0]
Compute from Python calling Rust
Compute from Rust calling Python
Get results from Python calling Rust

Print value from Python through Rust:  [1.0]
Print value directly from Python:  [1.0]
</code></pre>
<p>We have now successfully exposed a Rust model that implements the <code>Model</code> trait to Python!</p>
<p>We will now expose the <code>solve</code> function, but before, let’s talk about types errors.</p>
<h2 id="type-errors-in-python"><a class="header" href="#type-errors-in-python">Type errors in Python</a></h2>
<p>What happens if you have type errors when using Python and how can you improve the error messages?</p>
<h3 id="wrong-types-in-python-function-arguments"><a class="header" href="#wrong-types-in-python-function-arguments">Wrong types in Python function arguments</a></h3>
<p>Let’s assume in the first case that you will use in your Python file <code>my_rust_model.set_variables(2.0)</code> instead of <code>my_rust_model.set_variables([2.0])</code>.</p>
<p>The Rust signature expects a vector, which corresponds to a list in Python.
What happens if instead of a vector, we pass a single value ?</p>
<p>At the execution of Python, we get :</p>
<pre><code class="language-block">File &quot;main.py&quot;, line 15, in &lt;module&gt;
   my_rust_model.set_variables(2)
TypeError
</code></pre>
<p>It is a type error and Python points to it, so it’s easy to identify and solve.</p>
<h3 id="wrong-types-in-python-method-signatures"><a class="header" href="#wrong-types-in-python-method-signatures">Wrong types in Python method signatures</a></h3>
<p>Let’s assume now that the return type of one of the methods of our Model class is wrong, for example the <code>get_results</code> method that is expected to return a <code>Vec&lt;f64&gt;</code> in Rust, a list in Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Model:
    def set_variables(self, inputs):
        self.inputs = inputs
    def compute(self):
        self.results = [elt**2 -3 for elt in self.inputs]
    def get_results(self):
        return self.results[0]
        #return self.results &lt;-- this is the expected output
</code></pre>
<p>This call results in the following panic:</p>
<pre><code class="language-block">pyo3_runtime.PanicException: called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: PyErr { type: Py(0x10dcf79f0, PhantomData) }
</code></pre>
<p>This error code is not helpful for a Python user that does not know anything about Rust, or someone that does not know PyO3 was used to interface the Rust code.</p>
<p>However, as we are responsible for making the Rust code available to Python, we can do something about it.</p>
<p>The issue is that we called <code>unwrap</code> anywhere we could, and therefore any panic from PyO3 will be directly forwarded to the end user.</p>
<p>Let’s modify the code performing the type conversion to give a helpful error message to the Python user:</p>
<p>We used in our <code>get_results</code> method the following call that performs the type conversion:</p>

<p>By doing so, you catch the result of the Python computation and check its type in order to be able to deliver a better error message before performing the unwrapping.</p>
<p>Of course, it does not cover all the possible wrong outputs:
the user could return a list of strings instead of a list of floats.
In this case, a runtime panic would still occur due to PyO3, but with an error message much more difficult to decipher for non-rust user.</p>
<p>It is up to the developer exposing the rust code to decide how much effort to invest into Python type error handling and improved error messages.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-code"><a class="header" href="#the-final-code">The final code</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s expose the <code>solve()</code> function to make it available from Python.</p>
<p>It is not possible to directly expose the <code>solve</code> function to Python, as the type conversion cannot be performed.
It requires an object implementing the <code>Model</code> trait as input.</p>
<p>However, the <code>UserModel</code> already implements this trait.
Because of this, we can write a function wrapper that takes the <code>UserModel</code>–which has already been exposed to Python–as an argument in order to call the core function <code>solve</code>.</p>
<p>It is also required to make the struct public.</p>

<p>PyO3 provides an easy to use interface to code native Python libraries in Rust. The accompanying Maturin allows you to build and publish them as a package. Yet, for the better user experience, Python libraries should provide typing hints and documentation for all public entities, so that IDEs can show them during development and type analyzing tools such as <code>mypy</code> can use them to properly verify the code.</p>
<p>Currently the best solution for the problem is to maintain manually the <code>*.pyi</code> files and ship them along with the package.</p>
<h2 id="the-pyi-files-introduction"><a class="header" href="#the-pyi-files-introduction">The <code>pyi</code> files introduction</a></h2>
<p><code>pyi</code> (an abbreviation for <code>Python Interface</code>) is called a <code>Stub File</code> in most of the documentations related to them. Very good definition of what it is can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/wiki/Creating-Stubs-For-Python-Modules">old MyPy documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stubs file only contains a description of the public interface of the module without any implementations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably most Python developers encountered them already when trying to use the IDE “Go to Definition” function on any builtin type. For example the definitions of few standard exceptions look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class BaseException(object):
    args: Tuple[Any, ...]
    __cause__: BaseException | None
    __context__: BaseException | None
    __suppress_context__: bool
    __traceback__: TracebackType | None
    def __init__(self, *args: object) -&gt; None: ...
    def __str__(self) -&gt; str: ...
    def __repr__(self) -&gt; str: ...
    def with_traceback(self: _TBE, tb: TracebackType | None) -&gt; _TBE: ...

class SystemExit(BaseException):
    code: int

class Exception(BaseException): ...

class StopIteration(Exception):
    value: Any
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see those are not full definitions containing implementation, but just a description of interface. It is usually all that is needed by the user of the library.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-peps-say"><a class="header" href="#what-does-the-peps-say">What does the PEPs say?</a></h3>
<p>As of the time of writing this documentation the <code>pyi</code> files are referenced in three PEPs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-annotations">PEP8 - Style Guide for Python Code - #Function Annotations</a> (last point) recommends all third party library creators to provide stub files as the source of knowledge about the package for type checker tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(…) it is expected that users of third party library packages may want to run type checkers over those packages. For this purpose <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a> recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read by the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files. (…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files">PEP484 - Type Hints - #Stub Files</a> defines stub files as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stub files are files containing type hints that are only for use by the type checker, not at runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It contains a specification for them (highly recommended reading, since it contains at least one thing that is not used in normal Python code) and also some general information about where to store the stub files.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/">PEP561 - Distributing and Packaging Type Information</a> describes in detail how to build packages that will enable type checking. In particular it contains information about how the stub files must be distributed in order for type checkers to use them.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-do-it"><a class="header" href="#how-to-do-it">How to do it?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/">PEP561</a> recognizes three ways of distributing type information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>inline</code> - the typing is placed directly in source (<code>py</code>) files;</li>
<li><code>separate package with stub files</code> - the typing is placed in <code>pyi</code> files distributed in their own, separate package;</li>
<li><code>in-package stub files</code> - the typing is placed in <code>pyi</code> files distributed in the same package as source files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first way is tricky with PyO3 since we do not have <code>py</code> files. When it will be investigated and necessary changes are implemented, this document will be updated.</p>
<p>The second way is easy to do, and the whole work can be fully separated from the main library code. The example repo for the package with stub files can be found in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/#references">PEP561 references section</a>: <a href="https://github.com/ethanhs/stub-package">Stub package repository</a></p>
<p>The third way is described below.</p>
<h3 id="including-pyi-files-in-your-pyo3maturin-build-package"><a class="header" href="#including-pyi-files-in-your-pyo3maturin-build-package">Including <code>pyi</code> files in your PyO3/Maturin build package</a></h3>
<p>When source files are in the same package as stub files, they should be placed next to each other. We need a way to do that with Maturin. Also, in order to mark our package as typing-enabled we need to add an empty file named <code>py.typed</code> to the package.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-do-not-have-other-python-files"><a class="header" href="#if-you-do-not-have-other-python-files">If you do not have other Python files</a></h4>
<p>If you do not need to add any other Python files apart from <code>pyi</code> to the package, the Maturin provides a way to do most of the work for you. As documented in <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/blob/084cfaced651b28616aeea1f818bdc933a536bfe/guide/src/project_layout.md#adding-python-type-information">Maturin Guide</a> the only thing you need to do is create a stub file for your module named <code>&lt;module_name&gt;.pyi</code> in your project root and Maturin will do the rest.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">my-rust-project/
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project.pyi  # &lt;&lt;&lt; add type stubs for Rust functions in the my_project module here
├── pyproject.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
</code></pre>
<p>For example of <code>pyi</code> file see <a href="PyO3_guides/src/python_typing_hints.html#my_projectpyi-content"><code>my_project.pyi</code> content</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-need-other-python-files"><a class="header" href="#if-you-need-other-python-files">If you need other Python files</a></h4>
<p>If you need to add other Python files apart from <code>pyi</code> to the package, you can do it also, but that requires some more work. Maturin provides easy way to add files to package (<a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/blob/0dee40510083c03607834c821eea76964140a126/Readme.md#mixed-rustpython-projects">documentation</a>). You just need to create a folder with the name of your module next to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file (for customization see documentation linked above).</p>
<p>The folder structure would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── my_project.pyi
│   ├── other_python_file.py
│   └── py.typed
├── pyproject.toml
├── Readme.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s go a little bit more into details on the files inside the package folder.</p>
<h5 id="__init__py-content"><a class="header" href="#__init__py-content"><code>__init__.py</code> content</a></h5>
<p>As we now specify our own package content, we have to provide the <code>__init__.py</code> file, so the folder is treated as a package and we can import things from it. We can always use the same content that the Maturin creates for us if we do not specify a python source folder. For PyO3 bindings it would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from .my_project import *
</code></pre>
<p>That way everything that is exposed by our native module can be imported directly from the package.</p>
<h5 id="pytyped-requirement"><a class="header" href="#pytyped-requirement"><code>py.typed</code> requirement</a></h5>
<p>As stated in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/">PEP561</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Package maintainers who wish to support type checking of their code MUST add a marker file named py.typed to their package supporting typing. This marker applies recursively: if a top-level package includes it, all its sub-packages MUST support type checking as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we do not include that file, some IDEs might still use our <code>pyi</code> files to show hints, but the type checkers might not. MyPy will raise an error in this situation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: Skipping analyzing &quot;my_project&quot;: found module but no type hints or library stubs
</code></pre>
<p>The file is just a marker file, so it should be empty.</p>
<h5 id="my_projectpyi-content"><a class="header" href="#my_projectpyi-content"><code>my_project.pyi</code> content</a></h5>
<p>Our module stub file. This document does not aim at describing how to write them, since you can find a lot of documentation on it, starting from already quoted <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files">PEP484</a>.</p>
<p>The example can look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Car:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A class representing a car.

    :param body_type: the name of body type, e.g. hatchback, sedan
    :param horsepower: power of the engine in horsepower
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def __init__(self, body_type: str, horsepower: int) -&gt; None: ...

    @classmethod
    def from_unique_name(cls, name: str) -&gt; 'Car':
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Creates a Car based on unique name

        :param name: model name of a car to be created
        :return: a Car instance with default data
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

    def best_color(self) -&gt; str:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Gets the best color for the car.

        :return: the name of the color our great algorithm thinks is the best for this car
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
