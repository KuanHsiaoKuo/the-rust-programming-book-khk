## Introduction to Generics

Section Overview: In this section, we will learn about generics and how they can be used with functions, methods, and
custom types. We will also explore traits and lifetimes.

### Removing Duplication

- Generics are like a placeholder for another type.
- Functions can help remove duplication in code.
- The syntax for generics includes an open angle bracket followed by a letter t and then a close angle bracket.
- Rust's standard library has a compare module that includes the partial order or ord trait which is necessary for
  comparing custom data types.

### Using Generics with Structs

- We can use generics with structs to create more flexible code.
- When defining a struct with generics, we need to specify the type of the generic when creating an instance of the
  struct.

### Implementing Traits

- Traits define shared behavior between different types.
- We can implement traits on our own custom types using the impl keyword.
- Trait bounds allow us to restrict which types can be used with our generic functions or structs.

### Lifetimes

- Lifetimes ensure that references remain valid for as long as they are needed.
- We use apostrophes (') to denote lifetimes in Rust code.
- Lifetime elision rules allow us to omit explicit lifetime annotations in certain cases.

### Conclusion

Section Overview: In this section, we reviewed what we learned about generics, including how they can be used with functions, methods, and custom types. We also explored traits and lifetimes.

- Generics allow us to write more flexible and reusable code.
- Traits define shared behavior between different types.
- Lifetimes ensure that references remain valid for as long as they are needed.

## Generics in Type Definitions and Functions

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces generics and explains how they can be used in type definitions
and functions.

### Using Generics in Type Definitions

- Generics can be used not only in functions but also in type definitions.
- The `point` struct is an example of using generics in a type definition. The `t` parameter is used to define the type
  of `x` and `y`.
- The `point` struct can take on different characteristics depending on the types defined for `x` and `y`.
- Multiple types can be defined for a struct by separating them with a comma.

### Using Generics in Enums

- Enums can also use generics. The speaker provides examples of two enums from the standard library that use
  generics: `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`.
- The generic parameter is passed as an argument when creating instances of these enums.

### Using Generics in Methods

- Generics can also be used inside methods. The speaker uses the `point` struct as an example.
- When defining a method that uses generics, the generic parameter must be specified again in the implementation.
- Specific methods can be created for specific types by targeting them with their own implementations.

### Mixing Types with Generics

- Mixing types with generics is possible using methods like `mix_up()`.
- The method takes two points as arguments, each with its own set of generic parameters.
- The output ignores one of the generic parameters while returning the other.

## Introduction to Generics and Traits

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces generics and traits in Rust programming language. They explain how generics work, their performance implications, and how they can be used with different data types. The speaker also discusses traits, which are similar to interfaces in other programming languages.

### Generics

- Generics allow for code reuse by creating functions that can work with multiple data types.
- Using generics can impact performance as it requires the compiler to do more work and may result in a larger binary.
- Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in concrete types used at
  compile time.
- The compiler outputs specific code for each data type used with a generic function.

### Traits

- Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages.
- A trait defines a set of methods that can be implemented by custom data types.
- Custom data types implement traits using an implementation block.
- Different custom data types can have different implementations for the same trait method.
- Traits can be defined as public so they can be used in other modules.

### Using Traits as Parameters

- Traits can be used as parameters in functions to allow for greater flexibility and reusability.

## Rust Generics and Traits

Section Overview: This section covers the use of generics and traits in Rust programming.

### Using Generics with Traits

- Rust uses generics to implement traits.
- Multiple traits can be implemented by a single generic type.
- Generic types can also implement multiple traits as parameters in a function.
- The `where` keyword can be used to make the code more readable when implementing multiple conformances for generics.

### Returning Different Concrete Types Based on Business Logic

- Functions may return different concrete types based on business logic.
- Rust does not allow returning different concrete types from a function, but this issue is covered in Chapter 17 of the
  Rust Programming Book.
- A workaround for this issue is using dynamic dispatch with the `dyn` keyword.

### Fixing Issues with Partial and Copy Traits

- When returning values instead of references, items must be copyable or cloned.
- Dynamic dispatch can be used as a workaround for issues with partial and copy traits.

Overall, this section covers how to use generics and traits in Rust programming, including implementing multiple traits
with a single generic type, returning different concrete types based on business logic, and fixing issues related to
partial and copy traits.

## Understanding Lifetimes in Rust

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces lifetimes in Rust and explains how they are used to validate
the scope of variables being passed into a function.

### Introduction to Lifetimes

- Lifetimes are used to validate the scope of variables being passed into a function.
- The speaker reviews scopes and provides an example where a reference is made to a variable that has already been
  dropped, resulting in a dangling pointer.
- Lifetimes help get rid of dangling pointers.

### Implementing Lifetimes

- The speaker provides an example of implementing lifetimes using references and explicit lifetime syntax.
- The rest compiler helps identify when lifetime parameters need to be introduced for borrowed values.
- An example is provided where lifetime parameters are added to fix errors identified by the rust compiler.

### Output Lifetimes

- The speaker discusses output lifetimes and how they connect input lifetimes with output lifetimes.
- An example is provided where two strings are passed into a function, and the longest string is returned as output.
- The rest compiler identifies when output lifetimes do not match input lifetimes, resulting in borrowed values being
  dropped too early.

Overall, this section provides an introduction to lifetimes in Rust and demonstrates their importance in validating
variable scopes. Examples are provided throughout to illustrate how lifetime syntax can be implemented and how the rust
compiler can help identify errors related to borrowed values.

## Dangling Pointers and Lifetimes

Section Overview: This section covers the concept of dangling pointers and how lifetimes are used to prevent them in
Rust.

### Dangling Pointers

- A result returned as a string can cause a dangling pointer, which means it gets dropped and cleaned up.
- Borrowed types as str cannot live as long as needed, causing issues with dangling pointers.

### Lifetimes in Structs

- Lifetimes not only go into function parameters but also into structs.
- An example is given where an excerpt needs to live for the same amount of time as the reference it holds.
- Both the novel and excerpt need to have the same lifetime so they can be valid for the same amount of time.

### Rules for Lifetime Elision

- The compiler assigns a lifetime value to each parameter that is a reference.
- If there's exactly one input lifetime parameter, then there is a lifetime parameter assigned to all of the output.
- If there are multiple input lifetime parameters but one of them is a reference to self or mutable self, then the
  lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.

## Understanding Lifetimes in Rust

Section Overview: In this video, the presenter explains how lifetimes work in Rust. He covers the three elision rules
and how they apply to functions and methods with multiple parameters. He also discusses how to use traits and generics
with lifetimes.

### Lifetime Rules for Functions

- Each parameter gets its own lifetime.
- Rule two does not apply because there are multiple parameters.
- Rule three doesn't apply because there's no method.

### Specifying Output Lifetime

- When a function has two different parameters, it is unclear what the lifetime of the output should be.
- The programmer must manually insert the appropriate lifetime into the application.

### Lifetime Rules for Methods

- Each parameter gets its own lifetime.
- Since there is more than one parameter, rule two does not apply.
- If a method references `self`, then the return type must have the same lifetime as `self`.

### Static Lifetime

- `static` is a special type of lifetime that applies to variables or data that needs to be around for the entirety of
  an application running.
- If a compiler suggests using `static` but it doesn't seem appropriate, check if any functions used within that code
  need their lifetimes adjusted.

## Advanced Scenarios

The presenter briefly mentions advanced scenarios where traits and lifetimes can be used together. For more information
on these topics, refer to Chapter 17 of "The Rust Programming Language" book or check out the Rust reference
documentation.

Overall, this video provides a clear explanation of how lifetimes work in Rust and offers helpful tips for working with
them effectively.
