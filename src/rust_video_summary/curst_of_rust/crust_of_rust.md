> In this series we seek to understand intermediate Rust concepts by diving into real examples and working code, often
> by re-implementing functionality from the standard library. These episodes are not targeted at newcomers to Rust, but at
> those who have read The Book and have the theoretical knowledge, but want to see how these concepts translate into real
> use.
