> In this series we seek to understand intermediate Rust concepts by diving into real examples and working code, often
> by re-implementing functionality from the standard library. These episodes are not targeted at newcomers to Rust, but
> at
> those who have read The Book and have the theoretical knowledge, but want to see how these concepts translate into
> real
> use.

- John Gjengset (author of <Rust for Rustaceans>)

> Jon Gjengset has worked in the Rust ecosystem since the early days of
> Rust 1.0, and built a high-performance relational database from scratch
> in Rust over the course of his PhD at MIT. He’s been a frequent contributor to the Rust toolchain and ecosystem,
> including the asynchronous runtime Tokio, and maintains several popular Rust crates, such as hdrhistogram and inferno.
> Jon has been teaching Rust since 2018, when he started live-stream- ing intermediate-level Rust programming sessions.
> Since then, he’s made videos that cover advanced topics like async and await, pinning, variance, atomics, dynamic
> dispatch, and more, which have been received enthusiasti- cally by the Rust community.
