## Using RC and RefCell in Rust

Section Overview: The speaker explains what RC (reference counted) and RefCell are in Rust, how they work, and provides
examples of their usage.

- The speaker enters the standard library in Rust to use sync RC and RefCell.
- The speaker explains that reference count is used to keep track of ownership or usage of a struct, while RefCell is
  used for shared access to a struct without allowing it to be destroyed until everyone is finished using it.
- The speaker notes that "reference" is being used for two distinct types of references in Rust, which can be confusing.
  They provide an example of creating a shared access struct using RC.

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker creates an API using RC and explains its implementation.

### Creating an API with RC

- [](t=0:08:56s) The speaker creates an API using RC by initializing it with literal syntax.
- [](t=0:09:28s) The speaker derives debug from the created API.
- [](t=0:09:32s) Rust analyzer indicates that everything is okay, although there are a couple of warnings.

### Implementation of Clone Method

- [](t=0:11.02s) The speaker creates references to the API using clone method which clones a reference not an object.
- [](t=0.11.33s) When we clone a reference, it increments the counter as implemented in Clone trait.

## [#](t=0.12.21s) Inspecting Internals of Created Object

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker inspects internals of created objects and manipulates them.

### Inspecting Internals of Created Object

- [](t=0:12:35s) The speaker inspects the internals of the API object and notes that it is an immutable reference.
- [](t=0:13:08s) To get to the internals, we need to look at the documentation and find some of these methods that might
  have counts.

### Manipulating Created Object

- There are no bullet points for this section.

## Rust Analyzer Difficulty Finding Questions Directory

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how Rust Analyzer will have difficulty finding the questions
directory because it is in the wrong directory. The speaker then proceeds to move everything into Main and delete the
questions directory.

### Moving Source into Main

- Rust Analyzer has difficulty finding the questions directory.
- Move Source into Main to fix the issue.

### Deleting Questions Directory

- Delete the questions directory.
- Workspace settings are deleted accidentally while deleting the questions directory.

## Understanding RC and Ref Counting

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about RC and ref counting. They discuss how they want to get ins
into the number of counts and wonder if there is a strong count. The speaker also explains that strong count is not an
inherent method of type but rather a free function that exists inside RC.

### Getting Ins Into Number of Counts

- Speaker wants to get ins into number of counts.
- Strong count is not an inherent method of type but rather a free function that exists inside RC.
- Strong count is actually a static method of RC type and does not have self so a reference to an object needs to be
  taken.

### Interior Mutability and Unsafe Cell

- Interior mutability creates a facade of immutability but enables types to change their interior state.
- All interior immutability is provided by unsafe cell which provides an immutable facade even though the interior is
  changing because it can guarantee all references will stay in the same place.
- Rust compiler guarantees precise aliasing and will not allow two references to refer to the same position in memory or
  both believe that they have the ability to mutate a value.

## [#](t=0:22:05s) Ampersand Mute and Rust's Memory Model

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains Rust's memory model and how it handles mutable references. They
discuss the limitations of mutable references and introduce shared references as a solution. The speaker then introduces
RefCell as a way to provide shared ownership semantics.

### Mutable References

- [](t=0:22:24s) This presents a problem when dealing with shared resources.
- [](t=0:23:21s) RefCell provides an extra guarantee that reference counting and shared mutability semantics will play
  nicely together.

### RefCell

- [](t=0:23:56s) RefCell enables dynamic checking and provides shared ownership semantics.
- [](t=0:24:51s) RefCell uses unsafe code under the hood but enforces the same semantics at runtime.
- [](t=0:26:38s) RefCell provides an extra bit of correctness for shared ownership semantics.

## [#](t=0:28:25s) Implementing RC Ourselves

- The speaker defines an increment function that takes an immutable reference to an i32 and returns a mutable reference
  to ni32.
- They explain that the function increments the value by one.

### Add To Function

- The speaker creates a second function called add to that adds 2 to n.
- This involves creating a function that takes a mutable reference to an i32 and returns a reference.

## [2194s](t=0:36:34) Rust Re-borrowing

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how Rust's compiler has been smart in adding a re-borrow to the
code. They explain how it works and why it is not a copy or clone.

### Re-borrowing

- The compiler has added a re-borrow to the code.
- This allows for the original data to be re-borrowed again in a different scope.
- The second borrow enables the data to be used in a different way.

## [2348s](t=0:39:08) Rust Mutable References

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how mutable references work in Rust and what happens when there
are two mutable references to one object.

### Two Mutable References

- Creating two mutable references to one object breaks Rust's rules.
- Even though it is not allowed, it is still legal code.
- When trying to use both mutable references, only one can be used at a time.
- Implicit control flow exists in some instances of Rust, such as with d-ref trait.

## [2607s](t=0:43:27) Re-Borrow Crate

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the Re-Borrow crate and explains how it can help solve
problems related to re-borrowing objects that have been moved out of scope.

### The Re-Borrow Crate

- The Re-Borrow crate provides examples of where re-borrowing can be useful.
- It allows for mutating an object even after it has been moved out of scope.

## Understanding Rust's Re-borrow Feature

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses Rust's re-borrow feature and how it enables the use of mutable
references in places where it would be a breach of lifetime ownership rules.

### Re-borrowing in Rust

- The compiler determines when an object has reached the end of its lifetime, allowing for a mutable reference to be
  used again.
- Overlapping lifetimes can cause issues with aliasing rules, but re-borrowing can help extend the utility of a
  reference.
- The re-borrowed reference is essentially fake and only exists on the source code level. There is only one pointer, but
  giving it a new binding makes ownership rules easier to follow.

### Passing Mutable References into Functions

- When passing a mutable reference into a function, that particular reference is essentially moved. Only one reference
  can exist at any given time.
- If there are multiple references to an object, they must all be immutable except for one mutable reference.

## Motivation Behind Rust's Re-Borrow Feature

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses why Rust's re-borrow feature was implemented and how it
contributes to developer happiness.

### Ergonomics in Rust

- The compiler engineers who designed Rust wanted it to be as ergonomic as possible for developers.
- The re-borrow feature allows for more flexibility in using mutable references without violating lifetime ownership
  rules.

## Moving References in Rust Functions

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how moving references work in Rust functions and how they relate
to mutable references.

### Moving References

- When passing a mutable reference into a function, that particular reference is essentially moved.
- If there are multiple references to an object, they must all be immutable except for one mutable reference.

## [#](t=0:51:47s) Shared References and Mutable Borrowing

### Shared References and Mutable Borrowing

- [](t=0:51:47s) The speaker explains that a shared reference is needed for mutable borrowing.
- [](t=0:52:17s) The variable R is introduced as a mutable reference to the meaning of life.
- [](t=0:52:28s) The question of the lifetime of R is raised.
- [](t=0:53:24s) If ownership of a variable has been given away, attempting to access it again through a reference is
  illegal in Rust.

## [#](t=0:54:08s) Breaking Rust's Rules

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses breaking Rust's rules by creating multiple references to an
object.

### Creating Multiple References

- [](t=0:54:31s) Rust prevents creating two references to an object with the ability to change its value.
- [](t=0:55:11s) It is possible to cast a pointer as a u64 and create new pointers, but dereferencing them would be
