## Difference Between String and Stir

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses a common question about Rust programming language.

- One of the most popular questions is about the difference between string and stir in Rust.
- A beginner-friendly answer is needed as some technical answers may not be suitable for beginners.
- Rust does not have a string literal type like Python's capital S string type. Instead, it has a stir type that
  represents a string literal.
- Converting stir to a capital S string is possible using certain methods.

## Technicalities of Strings in Rust

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker delves deeper into strings in Rust programming language.

- There are differences between variables named "item" in Python and Rust due to their respective syntaxes.
- Creating a capital S string literal syntax is not possible in Rust.
- A stir type must first be created before converting it into a capital S string using certain methods.

## [#](t=0:06:11s) Rust Programming Language

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains why Rust has two types of string literals and how they differ.

### Two Types of String Literals

- [](t=0:06:11s) There are two types of string literals in Rust.
- [](t=0:06:28s) The way computers work requires specificity, and Rust aligns itself with the computer's memory
  management model.
- [](t=0:06:54s) A string literal during execution starts as a fixed section of binary code.
- [](t=0:07:17s) Static storage is a part of memory outside the stack and heap that exists for the entire lifetime of
  the program.

## [#](t=0:07:56s) Lifetime Annotations

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what lifetime annotations are and how they relate to static
storage.

### Lifetime Annotations

- [](t=0:07:37s) Anything with an apostrophe prefix has a lifetime annotation.
- [](t=0:07:56s) A string does not exist at the start but can be created during runtime.
- [](t=0:08:44s) The full type of a reference to a string is `&static str`.
- [](t=0:09:16s) A reference to a string has guaranteed UTF-8 encoding with a lifetime of static.

## [#](t=0:10.14s) Strings vs Stings Literal

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker compares strings and string literals in Rust.

### Strings vs String Literals

- [](t=0.10.14s) Passing around strings is less mental overhead than passing around stirng literals.
- [](t=0.11.20s) When using a string, the compiler does not know the length of a stirng literal.
- [](t=0:11:49s) A reference is required to use a string literal as an argument.

## [0:12:52](t=772s) Memory Management in Rust

Section Overview: The speaker explains how memory is managed in Rust and the difference between a destructor and a
string. They also discuss the responsibilities of an owner and why an ampersand is required for stir but not string.

### Memory Management

- In Rust, a destructor or `free` function is used to free memory.
- A hidden function called `drop` is inserted by the compiler at the end of a scope where variables are owned.
- The owner's responsibility is to call the destructor of any owned things at the end of its life cycle.
- An ampersand is required for stir but not string because ownership retains with main, and greet only has read access
  to name.

### Compiler Warnings

- A compiler warning occurs when greet does not want to call the destructor, resulting in memory being available twice.
- To retain access to name, we must use a reference which provides read-only access to string.

### Difference Between String Types

- The difference between Rust's `String` type and its `str` type lies in their ownership and mutability.
- Ownership of `String` can be transferred while that of `str` cannot be transferred.
- Mutability can be changed for `String`, but not for `str`.

## [0:17:32](t=1052s) Differences Between Rust String Type and Its Stir Type

Section Overview: The speaker discusses why it's difficult to understand the differences between Rust's String type and
its stir type. They explain that understanding these differences requires knowledge about Rust.

### Understanding Differences Between String Types

- Understanding differences between Rust's String type and its stir type requires knowledge about Rust.
- Ownership can be transferred for String but not str.
- Mutability can be changed for String but not str.

## Compiler Comments

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about how the compiler comments can be useful or not during a demo.

### Compiler Comments

- The speaker mentions that there is no need for compiler comments during a demo.
- They express gratitude towards the compiler but prefer to have control over their demo.
- The speaker acknowledges that compiler comments can be useful in other situations.

## Rust Analyzer and Rusty LSP

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses two language server protocols for Rust: Rust Analyzer and Rusty
LSP.

### Language Server Protocols

- The speaker mentions that Rust has two language server protocols: Rust Analyzer and Rusty LSP.
- They describe Rust Analyzer as newer and more interesting while describing Rusty LSP as older and more established.
- The speaker suggests sticking with strings when beginning with rust before moving on to more complex types.

## Creating Variables in Rust

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to create variables in rust using strings.

### Creating Variables with Strings

- The speaker suggests using strings when starting out with rust.
- They explain that if issues arise with ownership, adding a reference can help indicate read-only access.
- As users become more competent with rust, they can move on to accepting both strings and stirs by using generics.

## Accepting Both Strings and Stirs in Functions

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to accept both strings and stirs in functions using
generics.

### Accepting Both Strings and Stirs

- The speaker explains that it is possible to use generics to accept both strings and stirs in functions.
- They mention that implementing "as ref into string" trait allows calling either a string or a stir.
- The speaker notes that strings have extra functionality and can be owned by a specific scope.

## String Conversion in Rust

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses string conversion in Rust and how to convert any type that can
convert itself into a string.

### Converting Types to Strings

- The `String` type provides more functionality than a regular string.
- To convert any type that can convert itself into a string, use the `Into` trait.
- The `Into` trait is an interface that restricts types to those that implement it.
- The `ToString` trait is used by the `Display` trait for representing types as strings.

### Using AsRef vs. Into

- Use `AsRef` when you need a lightweight conversion.
- Use `Into` when you need dynamic allocation and creation of a new string type.

## Rust String and Str

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains the difference between Rust string and stirrer. He also talks
about how understanding these concepts is fundamental to understanding Rust programming.

### Understanding Rust String and Stirrer

- The speaker explains that to understand the difference between Rust string and stirrer, one needs to take out the
  reference to the internal stir like internal array of bytes or pass it to great.
- Understanding these concepts is fundamental to understanding borrowing, memory management, etc.
- Over time, one will learn what it means by dynamic string type like rick.
- Display is a good suggestion for printing out a greeting to the console.

## Print Line in Rust Unit Tests

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about why print line does not work in Rust unit tests.

### Why Print Line Does Not Work in Rust Unit Tests

- To call something a unit test on rust is to give it this test annotation.
- By convention, we can call the console function a test function just by including this test annotation.
- The question is why print line does not work in rust unit tests.

## [#](t=0:37:39s) Test Output and Rust Compiler Optimization

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses how tests hide output when they succeed, how to specify other
flags in Rust, and why the Rust compiler does not optimize code assuming that two mutable references cannot alias.

### Hiding Output When Tests Succeed

- [](t=0:37:39s) When tests succeed, they hide output.
- [](t=0:38:07s) If an assertion is made that something is true which is actually false, more console output will be
  displayed.
- [](t=0:38:34s) Other flags can be specified in Rust, such as "no capture."

### Rust Compiler Optimization

- [](t=0:38:50s) The Rust compiler does not optimize code assuming that two mutable references cannot alias.
- [](t=0:41:01s) Mutable references are both pointers representing some place in memory and can never refer to the same
  memory address by definition under Rust's language.
- [](t=0:41:56s) LLVM is used for optimization of binary code.

## [#](t=0:39:06s) Learning Rust and Assembly

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about a tweet he made regarding learning Rust and how he will try
his best to explain a particular topic that matters to people who care about assembly.

### Learning Rust

- [](t=0:39:06s) The speaker referenced a tweet he made regarding learning Rust being easy because it's a systems
  programming language.
- [](t=0:39.27s) The burden of making things simple should be on the teacher rather than the learner.

### Assembly

- [](t=0.40.16s) The speaker spent 40 minutes discussing different types of strings before moving onto assembly.
- [](t=0:40:49s) The speaker will try his best to explain a particular topic that matters to people who care about
  assembly.
- [](t=0:41:21s) Rust's compiler should optimize code assuming that two mutable references cannot alias.

## [#](t=0:39:55s) Tricky Question

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker talks about a tricky question he has to deal with.

### Tricky Question

- [](t=0:39:55s) The speaker has to deal with a tricky question.
- [](t=0:40:09s) The speaker is unsure of how to proceed.

## [0:43:44](t=2624s) Compiler Bugs and Unused Code Warnings

Section Overview: The speaker discusses compiler bugs and unused code warnings in Rust, explaining that there are
legitimate reasons why a compiler should be instructed to compile code even though it doesn't exist in the control flow.

- There were compiler bugs that caused some problems with unused code warnings.
- The speaker explains that sometimes the compiler is wrong about what code will be accessed and there are legitimate
  reasons for compiling dead code.
- Legitimate use cases include creating functions called by the CPU outside of program flow.

## [0:47:24](t=2844s) Printing Variable Types

Section Overview: The speaker explains how to print the type of a variable in Rust.

- To find out the type of a variable, you can do something that you know is wrong and get the compiler to tell you why
  it's wrong.
- If you want to store something on disk or really print out the type, you can use `std::any::type_name`.

## Understanding Rust's Generic Types and Traits

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains Rust's generic types and traits. They recommend starting with
Rust by Example to learn the language.

### Starting with Rust by Example

- Rust by Example is a series of small discrete examples that can be run in the browser.
- It provides a sense of how to run code and comes out with "Hello World."
- The code is sent to the rust playground, which is play.rust-lang.org.
- If you need more information or a guided tour, you can message the speaker offline.

### Understanding Generics

- Generics are ways for variables to have multiple possible types.
- They allow for code reuse without having to write new functions for each type.
- The Manning LiveBook has several chapters on generics that can be accessed online.

### Understanding Traits

- There are two kinds of traits: inherent and trait objects.
- Inherent traits are implemented directly on a type, while trait objects are implemented on an object that implements
  the trait.
- Traits allow for polymorphism in Rust.

## [#](t=0:56:11s) Introduction to Traits and Generics

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces traits and generics in Rust programming language.

### What are Generics?

- [](t=0:56:11s)Generics allow writing less source code and pushing more work to the compiler.
- [](t=0:56:23s)A generic type is used as a function within a function to tell the compiler that it should do this work
  itself.
- [](t=0:57:50s)The compiler goes for every single type that is called and creates a specific function for every single
  one.

### What are Traits?

- [](t=0:58:15s)Traits can be thought of as an abstract base class in object-oriented programming languages.
- [](t=1:00:27s)A trait is just the definition of functions.
- [](t=1:00:45s)Empty is the string literal syntax for constructing a given type, which turns out to be represented
  outside of memory at all.

## [#](t=1:01:06s) Implementing Traits and Types

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to implement traits and types in Rust programming language.

### Implementing Traits

- [](t=1:00:08s)Implementing traits means defining new types that satisfy the requirements specified by those traits.
- [](t=1:00.22s)An empty trait can have no methods, which is formerly known as a marker trait.
- [](t=1.01.33s)To implement a trait for a new type, we define an implementation block with our new type name followed
  by impl keyword.

### Constructing New Types

-[](t=1.01.33s)We construct new types using struct keyword followed by the name of the type and curly braces.
-[](t=1.01.37s)We can then implement traits for these new types.

## [#](t=1:02:05s) Conclusion

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes the video by summarizing what was covered in the previous
sections.

- [](t=1:02:05s)The video covered an introduction to traits and generics in Rust programming language.
- [](t=1:02:20s)Generics allow writing less source code and pushing more work to the compiler while traits can be
  thought of as an abstract base class in object-oriented programming languages.
- [](t=1:02:40s)To implement a trait for a new type, we define an implementation block with our new type name followed
  by impl keyword.
