## Introduction to Unit Testing in Rust

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the basics of unit testing in Rust. They explain what a unit
test is, how to create and run them, and why they are important.

### Creating a Project

- The speaker creates a new library called "midpoint" whose job is to find the midpoint of two integers.
- Rust provides demonstration code with tests that can be run using cargo test.

### Defining Midpoint Function

- The speaker defines the mid function which returns the midpoint of two integers.
- Tests are added for different input values.
- Running tests results in failures due to undefined functions.

### Fixing Midpoint Function

- The speaker fixes the mid function by defining it for different cases.
- More tests are added for different input values.
- Overflow error occurs when using larger integer values.

### Understanding Unit Tests

- A failing test is one that panics.
- A unit test is any function annotated with "test" that does not panic when executed.

Overall, this video provides an introduction to unit testing in Rust. It covers creating a project, defining and fixing
functions, and understanding what a unit test is.

## Assert Equals Macro

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what the assert equals macro does and how it works. They also
discuss how unit tests are defined in their own module.

### Assert Equals Macro

- The assert equals macro is used to panic if two values are not equal.
- Unit tests are often defined in their own module.
- Modules can be annotated with the config test annotation to only compile when running a test.

## Assert Macro

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains what the assert macro does and how it works.

### Assert Macro

- The assert macro takes an expression and evaluates it.
- It must return true and can be more sophisticated as long as it has a Boolean result.
- Multiple tests can be added using expressions such as greater than or less than.

## Pretty Assertion Thing

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses pretty assertion thing and demonstrates its use.

### Pretty Assertion Thing

- Pretty assertion thing is used to get a better understanding of why a test failed.
- It provides more information about where the difference between expected and actual values occurred.

## Conclusion

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes by expressing curiosity about whether anyone can figure out how
to define midpoint on size values without hitting that underflow bug.

### Conclusion

- The speaker expresses curiosity about defining midpoint on size values without hitting an underflow bug.
