## Some Guidelines about how to handle error in rust

> There are a few ways to handle errors in Rust:

1. The `Result` type:

This is Rust's built-in way of representing the success or failure of an operation. It has two variants: Ok for success and Err for failure. You can use the ? operator to automatically return Err if an expression returns Err, or you can use pattern matching to handle the Ok and Err variants
explicitly.

2. `Exceptions`:

3. `Panic!`:
   You can use the panic! macro to raise an exception, which will cause the program to unwind the stack and terminate. This is generally not recommended, as it can be difficult to recover from a panic and it can be difficult to debug.

4. `Early return`:
   You can simply return an error value from a function if something goes wrong, rather than trying to handle the error within the function. This can be a good option if the error is not recoverable or if you want to let the caller decide how to handle the error.

5. `Unwrap`:
   You can use the unwrap method on a Result value to get the inner value if it is Ok, or panic if it is Err. This is useful for prototyping or in situations where you are confident that the Result will always be Ok, but it can lead to hard-to-debug errors if the Result is actually Err.

6. `Custom error types`:
   You can define your own error types by implementing the std::error::Error trait, which allows you to provide more context about the error that occurred. This can be useful if you want to provide more information about the error to the caller, or if you want to define different error types for
   different situations.

> In general, it is a good idea to use the Result type and handle errors explicitly, rather than relying on exceptions or unwrapping. This will make your code more robust and easier to understand.
