# Functions & Methods

## Functions

> Ignoring [elision], function signatures with lifetimes have a few constraints:

* any reference *must* have an annotated lifetime.
* any reference being returned *must* have the same lifetime as an input or
  be `static`.

Additionally, note that returning references without input is banned if it
would result in returning references to invalid data.

~~~admonish tip title="The following example shows off some valid forms of functions with lifetimes:" collapsible=true
```rust,editable
// One input reference with lifetime `'a` which must live
// at least as long as the function.
fn print_one<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    println!("`print_one`: x is {}", x);
}

// Mutable references are possible with lifetimes as well.
fn add_one<'a>(x: &'a mut i32) {
    *x += 1;
}

// Multiple elements with different lifetimes. In this case, it
// would be fine for both to have the same lifetime `'a`, but
// in more complex cases, different lifetimes may be required.
fn print_multi<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("`print_multi`: x is {}, y is {}", x, y);
}

// Returning references that have been passed in is acceptable.
// However, the correct lifetime must be returned.
fn pass_x<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 { x }

//fn invalid_output<'a>() -> &'a String { &String::from("foo") }
// The above is invalid: `'a` must live longer than the function.
// Here, `&String::from("foo")` would create a `String`, followed by a
// reference. Then the data is dropped upon exiting the scope, leaving
// a reference to invalid data to be returned.

fn main() {
    let x = 7;
    let y = 9;
    
    print_one(&x);
    print_multi(&x, &y);
    
    let z = pass_x(&x, &y);
    print_one(z);

    let mut t = 3;
    add_one(&mut t);
    print_one(&t);
}
```
~~~

1. One input reference with lifetime `'a` which must live at least as long as the function.
2. Mutable references are possible with lifetimes as well.
3. Multiple elements with different lifetimes. In this case, it would be fine for both to have the same lifetime `'a`,
4. but in more complex cases, different lifetimes may be required.
5. Returning references that have been passed in is acceptable.
6. However, the correct lifetime must be returned.

## Methods

Methods are annotated similarly to functions:

```rust,editable
struct Owner(i32);

impl Owner {
    // Annotate lifetimes as in a standalone function.
    fn add_one<'a>(&'a mut self) { self.0 += 1; }
    fn print<'a>(&'a self) {
        println!("`print`: {}", self.0);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut owner = Owner(18);

    owner.add_one();
    owner.print();
}
```

## Structs

Annotation of lifetimes in structures are also similar to functions:

```rust,editable
// A type `Borrowed` which houses a reference to an
// `i32`. The reference to `i32` must outlive `Borrowed`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Borrowed<'a>(&'a i32);

// Similarly, both references here must outlive this structure.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NamedBorrowed<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'a i32,
}

// An enum which is either an `i32` or a reference to one.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Either<'a> {
    Num(i32),
    Ref(&'a i32),
}

fn main() {
    let x = 18;
    let y = 15;

    let single = Borrowed(&x);
    let double = NamedBorrowed { x: &x, y: &y };
    let reference = Either::Ref(&x);
    let number    = Either::Num(y);

    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", single);
    println!("x and y are borrowed in {:?}", double);
    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", reference);
    println!("y is *not* borrowed in {:?}", number);
}
```

## Traits

Annotation of lifetimes in trait methods basically are similar to functions.
Note that `impl` may have annotation of lifetimes too.

```rust,editable
// A struct with annotation of lifetimes.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Borrowed<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

// Annotate lifetimes to impl.
impl<'a> Default for Borrowed<'a> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            x: &10,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let b: Borrowed = Default::default();
    println!("b is {:?}", b);
}
```
