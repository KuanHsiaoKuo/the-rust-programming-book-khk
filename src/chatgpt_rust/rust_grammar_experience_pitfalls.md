Grammar Points: Ownership Mechanisms 

Usage experience: variables can only be used once, if you want to use it multiple times, you have to consider using references. Under the ownership mechanism, factors such as borrowing situation and life cycle have to be considered 

Common pitfalls: After a variable is assigned once, it often fails to compile, because the ownership mechanism must be considered
